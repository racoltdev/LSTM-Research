The  medical  examiner’s  opinion  that  Ann  died  at 
least six hours before she was discovered by first 
responders 
therefore 
inadmissible  because  it  was  based  solely  on 
subjective observations by first responders with no 
training  in  death  scene  investigation  that  Ann’s 
skin  was  “cold”  and  her  body  was  “stiff”  and 
speculation  that  Ann  did  not  struggle  with  her 
attacker despite undisputed physical evidence that 
she did  .

II.  The defendant was entitled to a required finding of 
not guilty where the Commonwealth’s case depended 
on  expert  opinions  about  the  decedent’s  time  of 
death  that  failed  to  account  for  uncontroverted 
evidence  that  the  decedent  was  in  a  violent 
struggle  immediately  before  her  death,  when  the 
defendant was not present 
.  47 
 
III.  The admission of the unrebutted opinion testimony 
of  the  Commonwealth’s  “paint  expert”  that  the 
Defendant  intentionally  poured  paint  on  the 
decedent’s body immediately before first responders 
arrived  created  a  substantial  likelihood  of 
miscarriage  of  justice.  His  opinions  were 
unreliable  because  they  were  based  on  flawed 
experiments  which  he  was  unqualified  to  design, 
naked assumptions or both

The trial judge’s sua sponte decision to instruct
