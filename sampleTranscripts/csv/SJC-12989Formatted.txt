SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT......................................................................... 13
ARGUMENT
  Abdie’s motion to suppress should have been allowed be-
  cause the warrantless creation, retention, and inspection
  of video footage of the inside of his bedroom violated his
  constitutional rights ................................................................................... 15
  A. Both the filming of the inside of Abdie’s house and the later in-
     spection of the footage by the Gang Unit were searches requir-
     ing constitutional justification. ................................................................ 17
       1. The bodycam footage is “information” obtained through an
          “unlicensed physical intrusion” into Abdie’s home.......................... 17
       2. The creation, indefinite retention, and later review of a vid-
          eo recording of the inside of a person’s home intrude on that
          person’s reasonable expectation of privacy. .....................................18
            a. A police officer videotaping the inside of someone’s home
               is a much more significant intrusion on that person’s
               privacy than the officer’s mere presence.....................................18
            b. The subsequent inspection of the footage by other offic-
               ers for purposes unrelated to its initial creation was a
               new and separate intrusion on Abdie’s reasonable ex-
               pectation of privacy in his home..................................................23
  B. The recording of the inside of the Yusufs’ apartment was un-
     constitutional because it exceeded the scope of the permission
     granted to police to enter the home..........................................................25
  C. The filming was not justified by the other exceptions to the
     warrant requirement alluded to by the motion judge. ........................ 28




                                                       2
  D. The public policy concerns animating the motion judge’s con-
     clusion that the recording was lawful cannot justify pro-
     grammatic suspicionless filming of the insides of people’s
     homes for general law enforcement purposes....................................... 30

                          ISSUE PRESENTED
    Whether the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitu-
tion and article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights forbid
police from videotaping the inside of every home to which they are
admitted for any purpose, archiving and preserving those record-
ings forever, and reviewing them without a warrant any time any
officer believes they may be pertinent to any ongoing investigation.

                      STATEMENT OF THE CASE
    On June 28, 2017, a Suffolk County grand jury returned indict-
ment #17-455, charging Abdirahman Yusuf with unlawful possession
of a firearm, G.L. c.269, §10(h), having previously been convicted of a
violent crime, see G.L. c.269, §10G; possession of a large-capacity
firearm, G.L. c.269, §10(m); and unlawful possession of ammunition,
G.L. c.269, §10(h) (R18–21).1 Mr. Yusuf was arraigned on July 20, 2017,
and pleaded not guilty (R3).
    Mr. Yusuf filed a motion to suppress the evidence against him
on July 12, 2018 (R22). An evidentiary hearing was held on Septem-
ber 5, 2018, before Judge Michael Ricciuti (R9). On September 24, the
motion judge issued a written memorandum and order denying the
motion (R39/A37).
    On May 7, 2019, Mr. Yusuf waived his right to a jury trial in a
colloquy with Judge Robert Tochka (R13). The trial judge heard evi-
dence on May 7 and May 17, and took the case under advisement (R
13–14). On May 23, 2019, he found Mr. Yusuf guilty of unlawfully
possessing a firearm and ammunition, but not guilty of possessing a

large-capacity firearm (Tr.3/3). No evidence was presented on the
sentencing enhancement, and a not guilty finding entered as to that
portion of the indictment (Tr.3/9). The judge sentenced Mr. Yusuf
on count 1 to a term of two years in the house of correction, with a
year of probation to follow on count 3 (Tr.3/8). Mr. Yusuf’s timely
notice of appeal was docketed on June 3, 2019 (R16,60). Following
the allowance of Mr. Yusuf’s application for direct appellate review,
the matter was entered in this Court on July 23, 2020.

                        STATEMENT OF FACTS
    Two brothers, Abdie and Yusuf Yusuf,2 were charged with fire-
arm offenses following the execution of a search warrant at the
Dorchester apartment where they lived with their parents and the
rest of their family. The warrant was the culmination of an investi-
gation of Abdie by the Boston Police Department’s Youth Violence
Strike Force, also known as the Gang Unit (R40/A38). Officers in
that unit believed that Abdie regularly possessed firearms, based in
part on their monitoring of social media. In particular, beginning in
June of 2016, police regularly viewed and recorded videos posted to
a Snapchat account with the username “dee.fazo,” several of which
appeared to show Abdie handling firearms (R41/A39). Abdie was
stopped and frisked on a number of occasions during that
timeframe, but was never found to be carrying a gun (R44/A42).
    In late 2016 or early 2017, Gang Unit Detective Brian Ball sent a
“friend” request to the “dee.fazo” Snapchat account using an under-
cover Snapchat account (R41/A39). The request was accepted, and

order of the brothers’ first names to distinguish between them.

                                  10
Ball began monitoring the account and preserving videos from it by
playing them on one cellphone and recording them with another (R
41/A39). Several of the videos Ball preserved included images of Ab-
die with what appeared to be firearms (R42/A40). On February 25,
2017, Ball viewed one such video showing Abdie holding a gun in
what looked like a bedroom, with a “distinctive curtain” behind him
(R42/A40). Based on the video’s appearance in the Snapchat inter-
face and his experience with the application, Ball believed that the
video had been recorded in the past 24 hours (R42/A40).
    Detective Ball then attempted to develop probable cause as to
the location where Abdie possessed the gun by viewing footage cap-
tured on February 10, 2017, by another police officer’s body-worn
camera when that officer responded to a call for a domestic disturb-
ance at the Yusufs’ apartment at 1 Ames Street in Dorchester (R43/A
41). A body-worn camera looks like a black box with a lens in the
middle, and is worn in the center of a police officer’s chest (M.46).
When it is actively recording, a red light on it illuminates and it pe-
riodically emits an audible beep (R43/A41). Officers who are as-
signed bodycams upload their footage to a Boston Police Depart-
ment hard drive at the end of each shift (M.51). The footage is then
saved “forever,” and can be “accessed if it’s requested as a result of
an ongoing investigation” (M.108,110).
    Ball testified that he was not present when the bodycam footage
was captured, but had been informed about its existence by Officer
Brian Delahanty, who had burned it from a Boston Police Depart-
ment hard drive onto a DVD that he kept in his desk, presumably
after submitting such a request (M.43,45). Officer Delahanty did not


                                  11
testify at the motion hearing, but Gang Unit Sergeant Detective Ste-
ven Broderick explained that as part of their investigation of Abdie,
the unit “reviewed … calls for service for [his] address,” and noticed
that there had been a call from that address and that one of the re-
sponding officers was equipped with a body-worn camera (M.111).
Detective Ball testified that when he heard that footage existed
showing the inside of Abdie’s home, he immediately knew it “could
be relevant at some point to a possible search warrant” (M.53).
    The bodycam footage was provided to the motion judge at the
hearing (M.22), and a copy has been filed for this Court’s review. It
shows the officer wearing the camera arriving at 1 Ames Street to
find other officers already present, speaking with two women on the
first floor. One of the women appears to be Abdie’s sister. She tells
police that Abdie and his girlfriend have been “doing too much ar-
guing,” that she wants Abdie’s girlfriend to leave, and that “they said
they’re getting dressed.” The officer then goes up the stairs into the
hallway outside Abdie’s bedroom. Abdie is standing in the doorway
to his bedroom, and his girlfriend can be seen in the bedroom zip-
ping up the outer layer of her clothing. When the officer asks what’s
happening, Abdie reiterates that his girlfriend is “getting dressed
and they’re rushing her. Can she get dressed?” Once Abdie’s girl-
friend is fully dressed, police escort her and Abdie down the stairs,
past Abdie’s sister, and out of the house. During the course of these
events, no one appears to notice the existence of the body-worn
camera, and there is no discussion of it by anyone in the apartment.
The motion judge found that “[n]o one at the [a]partment gave per-
mission to the police to use the body-worn camera” (R43/A41).


                                  12
    When he compared the February 10 bodycam footage to the
February 25 Snapchat video, Detective Ball believed that the curtain
that can be seen through the door of Abdie’s bedroom in the body-
cam footage looked the same as the curtain behind Abdie in the
Snapchat video (R43/A41). He therefore applied for a warrant to
search the apartment at 1 Ames Street (R31). The warrant issued on
February 27, 2017, and was executed on March 2 (R30,38). Various
items were seized from the apartment, including the items that Ab-
die eventually was convicted of unlawfully possessing (R38).

                    SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
    The warrantless creation, retention, and analysis of video foot-
age of the inside of Abdie’s bedroom violated his constitutional
right to be secure in his house against unreasonable searches. The
filming of the inside of Abdie’s bedroom was a search of his house
both because it was accomplished by means of a physical intrusion,
and because it impinged on his reasonable expectation of privacy in
his home. Infra, at 17–18. In addition, the subsequent inspection of
the footage for investigative purposes unrelated to the reason for the
officer’s presence in Abdie’s home constituted a new, independent
intrusion on his reasonable expectation of privacy that required a
separate constitutional justification. Infra, at 23–24. Any warrantless
search of a house is presumptively unreasonable and unconstitu-
tional. Because no warrant was ever obtained, these searches of Ab-
die’s home were unlawful. Infra, at 24–25.
    The judge’s conclusion that the recording was permissible
simply because the officer who shot it was lawfully present in the
house was error. Video recording the inside of someone’s home is a


                                  13
significantly greater intrusion on their privacy than simply entering
the house in order to accomplish a particular task. Infra, at 18–23.
Because no one gave permission for (or apparently even knew
about) this invasion of the Yusufs’ privacy, the officer’s filming ex-
ceeded the scope of his consent to enter the home, and his physical
intrusion was unlicensed and unreasonable to the extent it involved
that filming. Infra, at 25–28. Nor could any emergency or exigency
justify the recording, since it was not necessary to record the en-
counter in order to address the situation at hand. Infra, at 28–30.
    It may be that the Constitution does not categorically forbid
programmatic warrantless, suspicionless, nonconsensual filming of
police responses to citizens’ homes. Indeed, public policy may coun-
sel in favor of a comprehensive police bodycam program in order to
promote accountability and public trust. But in order for such a
program to pass constitutional muster, it must be strictly divorced
from the general police interest in law enforcement. The program
implemented by the Boston Police Department, by which footage is
archived and retained forever, and is readily available to any officer
who believes it may assist in any ongoing investigation, impermissi-
bly upsets the balance between individual freedom and government
surveillance. A constitutional bodycam program ideally should in-
corporate limits on the retention of footage and severe restrictions
on the permissible uses to which the footage may be put; the prima-
ry use of the footage should always be in service of the non–law en-
forcement purposes of the bodycam program. At the very least, in-
spection of a recording of the inside of someone’s home offends
constitutional principles in the absence of a warrant. Infra, at 30–35.


                                   14
                             ARGUMENT
Abdie’s motion to suppress should have been allowed because
the warrantless creation, retention, and inspection of video foot-
age of the inside of his bedroom violated his constitutional rights.
    Abdie moved to suppress the evidence found when the warrant
was executed, arguing, as pertinent to this appeal, that “[t]he video
of the interior of [his] residence was obtained without a warrant,
and should therefore be … suppressed from consideration in sup-
port of [Detective] Ball’s application for a search warrant” (R23). See
Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 439 Mass. 616, 625 (2003) (unlawfully ob-
tained information must be excluded from assessment of whether
affidavit establishes probable cause to issue warrant). Abdie argued
that the recording of the footage exceeded the scope of his sister’s
consent for police to enter their apartment, and that the subsequent
retrieval and viewing by police of footage of the inside of Abdie’s
home violated his reasonable expectation of privacy (R23).
    As Abdie argued below, without the bodycam footage to con-
nect the Snapchat video to Abdie’s bedroom, Detective Ball’s affida-
vit fails to establish a nexus between any suspected contraband and
the apartment at 1 Ames Street. See DeJesus, 439 Mass. at 626 (analyz-
ing affidavit to determine whether, when stripped of references to
unlawfully obtained evidence, it “contain[ed] sufficient information
for an issuing magistrate to determine … that the items reasonably
may be expected to be located in the place to be searched”). See gen-
erally Commonwealth v. Escalera, 462 Mass. 636, 641–643 (2012) (dis-
cussing “nexus” requirement). Thus, if the bodycam footage was un-
lawfully obtained, the items seized pursuant to the search warrant
must be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree. See DeJesus, supra.


                                  15
    The motion judge rejected Abdie’s arguments and denied the
motion. He held that the scene at 1 Ames Street on February 10 was
too “chaotic” to reasonably expect the officer wearing the bodycam
to obtain consent before filming the inside of Abdie’s home (R49/A
47). The judge did not conduct any meaningful analysis of Abdie’s
claim that his reasonable expectation of privacy had been violated
by the subsequent warrantless access to and use of the footage for
investigative purposes unrelated to the reason the police had been
admitted into his home. Instead, the judge merely asserted that the
claim was “unsupported by any law on point,” and declined to en-
gage with the underlying legal principles “[i]n the absence of further
guidance from the Appeals or Supreme Judicial Courts” (R51/A49).
    In reviewing the judge’s rulings, this Court must “accept [his]
subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error but conduct an inde-
pendent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.”
Commonwealth v. Tremblay, 480 Mass. 645, 652 (2018), quoting Com-
monwealth v. Clarke, 461 Mass. 336, 340 (2012). Here, that independent
review must lead to reversal. Abdie’s sister’s request for police to en-
ter their apartment in order to remove Abdie’s girlfriend from the
premises did not reasonably convey permission for them to film the
inside of Abdie’s bedroom. And even if the recording had been
permissibly made, the Gang Unit’s subsequent access to it and in-
vestigative use of it was still a significant invasion of Abdie’s privacy.
Absent a warrant, such an invasion is unreasonable; it violated Ab-
die’s rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Con-
stitution and article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.




                                   16
    A. Both the filming of the inside of Abdie’s house and the later
       inspection of the footage by the Gang Unit were searches
       requiring constitutional justification.
    The Fourth Amendment and art. 14 protect the people of Mas-
sachusetts against “unreasonable searches” of their persons, houses,
and possessions, by the government. Analysis of a claimed violation
of these provisions begins by asking “whether a search in the consti-
tutional sense took place.” Commonwealth v. Porter P., 456 Mass. 254,
259 (2010). Although the motion judge’s order is not entirely clear on
this point, his analysis suggests that he entertained doubts as to
whether the creation and review of footage of the inside of Abdie’s
home constituted “searches” at all. Both did. And in the absence of
either a warrant or some exception to the warrant requirement,
both searches were unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional.
        1. The bodycam footage is “information” obtained through
           an “unlicensed physical intrusion” into Abdie’s home.
    “When ‘the Government obtains information by physically in-
truding’ on persons, houses, papers, or effects, ‘a “search” within the
original meaning of the Fourth Amendment’ has ‘undoubtedly oc-
curred.’” Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. 1, 5 (2013), quoting United States v.
Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 406 n.3 (2012). Accord Commonwealth v. Leslie, 477
Mass. 48, 49 (2017) (“analytical framework set out in Jardines” also
applies to art. 14). The bodycam footage certainly is “information”
that was obtained by police. “And they gathered that information by
physically entering and occupying the area to engage in conduct not
explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner.” Jardines, 569
U.S. at 6. More specifically, as discussed further infra, although po-
lice were lawfully admitted to Abdie’s house for one purpose—to


                                     17
remove his girlfriend from the house—they were not given permis-
sion to film the inside of his home for a later, completely unrelated,
investigative use. Their “physical intrusion” into the house was
therefore “unlicensed” insofar as it involved that filming. Id. at 7.
        2. The creation, indefinite retention, and later review of a
           video recording of the inside of a person’s home intrude
           on that person’s reasonable expectation of privacy.
    In addition to that straightforward “physical intrusion” analysis,
a “search” also occurs any time an agent of the state intrudes on an
individual’s “reasonable expectation of privacy.” Porter P., 456 Mass.
at 259, citing California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 211 (1986). “At the risk
of belaboring the obvious, private residences are places in which the
individual normally expects privacy free of governmental intrusion
not authorized by a warrant, and that expectation is plainly one that
society is prepared to recognize as justifiable.” United States v. Karo,
468 U.S. 705, 714 (1984). See also Porter P., 456 Mass. at 260, citing Kyllo
v. United States, 533 U.S. 27 (2001). Contrary to the motion judge’s ap-
parent conclusion, both the video recording of the inside of Abdie’s
house, and the Gang Unit’s later retrieval and review of that footage,
infringed on Abdie’s reasonable expectation of privacy.
            a. A police officer videotaping the inside of someone’s
               home is a much more significant intrusion on that
               person’s privacy than the officer’s mere presence.
    The motion judge’s fundamental error was his apparent as-
sumption that there is no difference, in terms of the intrusion on a
person’s reasonable expectation of privacy, between a police officer
being present inside the person’s home, and his video recording the
interior of that home and preserving the recording “forever” (M.108)
for later perusal and investigative use. But as this Court acknowl-

                                    18
edged almost twenty years ago, the “intrusiveness” of a search of a
home surely is enhanced by recording. Commonwealth v. Balicki, 436
Mass. 1, 11–12 (2002). “It is one thing to be present in a home” for a
valid law enforcement purpose, “and of necessity … in a position
cursorily to notice many of its contents.” Id. at 12. “It is quite another
to inspect the contents of a home and to create a permanent record
of it for inspection by police, prosecutors, expert witnesses, and oth-
ers at any time in the future.” Id. “This record can be played and re-
played as many times as necessary or desired, and the images can be
focused or enlarged to show each detail of every item in that citi-
zen’s home.” Id. The intrusion occasioned by filming a police entry
into a home is thus not only significant at the time it occurs, but re-
mains so on an ongoing basis for as long as the video is retained.
And the privacy harm is renewed when that video is later viewed.
    The concerns animating this Court’s analysis in Balicki gain
even greater force in the context of the programmatic recording of
ever more police interactions as the use of bodycams is steadily ex-
panded. Cf. Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2218–2219 (2018),
citing Kyllo, 533 U.S. at 36 (rule adopted must take ongoing advances
in law enforcement surveillance technology into account). The
permanent retention of bodycam footage will result, over time, in
the creation of a vast archive of recordings of the inside of every
home to which any officer has been admitted for any purpose, to
which police have ready access any time they believe it may be per-
tinent to an ongoing investigation. As with other novel surveillance
technologies, this risks running afoul of “the founders’ intention ‘to
place obstacles in the way of a too permeating police surveillance.’”


                                   19
Commonwealth v. McCarthy, 484 Mass. 493, 499 (2020), quoting Car-
penter, 138 S. Ct. at 2214. Indeed, the privacy risks here are potentially
greater than those occasioned by “technological advances in the
surveillance of public space,” McCarthy, 484 Mass. at 501, because
they involve the creation of detailed records of the interiors of citi-
zens’ homes. See Kyllo, 533 U.S. at 37 (“In the home, … all details are
intimate details, because the entire area is held safe from prying
government eyes”); Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 529
(1967), quoting Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14 (1948) (“The
right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is also a grave con-
cern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to
dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance”).
    The judge’s blithe assumption that the creation and retention of
an indelible recording of a police entry into a private home poses no
threat to privacy so long as police “photographed only what they
saw in fulfilling their duties” (R50/A48) blinks reality. As the use of
bodycams becomes commonplace, and particularly as advancing
technology enables automated scanning of mountains of digital
footage (potentially including facial recognition technology), such a
holding would fail “to ‘assure preservation of that degree of privacy
against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was
adopted,’” and instead “would leave homeowners ‘at the mercy of
advancing technology.’” Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2214, quoting Kyllo, 533
U.S. at 34–35. 3 This is because, “in the pre-computer age, the great-

 As to whether the framers of art. 14, the Fourth Amendment, or
particularly the Fourteenth Amendment (through which the Fourth
was made applicable to the States), would have considered photog-

                                   20
est protections of privacy were neither constitutional nor statutory,
but practical.” McCarthy, 484 Mass. at 499, quoting Jones, 565 U.S. at
429 (Alito, J., concurring). The degree of privacy previously secured
not by law but merely by law enforcement’s pragmatic limitations
“must be preserved and protected as new technologies are adopted
and applied by law enforcement” that enable previously impracti-
cable infringements on privacy. McCarthy, 484 Mass. at 498, quoting
Commonwealth v. Almonor, 482 Mass. 35, 41 (2019).
    As this Court knows, “human memory does not function like a
video recording.” Commonwealth v. Gomes, 470 Mass. 352, 369 (2015).
An officer responding to a domestic disturbance, while he may “cur-
sorily” observe the house’s décor, Balicki, 436 Mass. at 12, is highly
unlikely to retain a detailed memory of the patterns on the curtains
of a bedroom he stood outside of for less than twenty seconds. This
is an example of the type of “practical” privacy safeguard lost when
police are equipped with cameras that permanently record every-
thing in their line of sight—including things they did not even see
or notice at the time—for later inspection and analysis. See United


raphy a more significant intrusion on privacy than mere observa-
tion, a clue may be found in Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis’s
seminal article on the concept of privacy in American law. That ar-
ticle expressed alarm that “[i]nstantaneous photographs … have in-
vaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life,” and noted,
with citations contemporaneous to the drafting of the Fourteenth
Amendment, that “[f]or years there has been a feeling that the law
must afford some remedy for the unauthorized circulation of por-
traits of private persons.” Warren & Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4
HARV. L. REV. 193, 195 (1890). See also id. at 213 (“The right of one who
has remained a private individual, to prevent his public portraiture,
presents the simplest case for” a legal remedy).

                                   21
States v. Johnson, 314 F. Supp. 3d 248, 255, 257 (D.D.C. 2018) (bodycam
footage “by its nature contains a wealth of information that would
not ordinarily be captured by more traditional materials, like writ-
ten police reports,” including “sensitive information in which wit-
nesses and others depicted on the footage have a legitimate privacy
interest”). Cf. Commonwealth v. Eason, 427 Mass. 595, 600–601 (1998)
(audio recording presents distinct constitutional issue from police
memory of overheard conversation).
    Contrary to the motion judge’s apparent conclusion, the mere
fact that the officer was lawfully present at the time he made the re-
cording does not obviate the Yusufs’ privacy interest against pho-
tography of the inside of their home. See, e.g., Jardines, 569 U.S. at 8–9
(opinion of the Court), 13–15 (Kagan, J., concurring) (lawfulness of
officer’s presence on front porch not dispositive of reasonableness
of dog sniff conducted there); Commonwealth v. Panetti, 406 Mass.
230, 234 (1989) (officer eavesdropping on conversation from crawl
space under apartment floor violated resident’s reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy, even though officer was lawfully present in crawl
space). See also Florida v. Riley, 488 U.S. 445, 464–465 (1989) (Brennan,
J., dissenting) (noting agreement of majority of Court that reasona-
bleness of homeowner’s expectation of privacy against aerial sur-
veillance does not depend on lawfulness of police presence in loca-
tion from which they make observations), and compare Dow Chemical
Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227, 237–238 & n.4 (1986) (approving aeri-
al surveillance photography of commercial property in light of re-
duced expectation of privacy as compared to home and curtilage),
with Ciraolo, 476 U.S. at 212–213 & n.1 (declining to pass on constitu-


                                   22
tionality of aerial photography of home’s curtilage even while hold-
ing “naked-eye observation” permissible).
           b. The subsequent inspection of the footage by other
              officers for purposes unrelated to its initial creation
              was a new and separate intrusion on Abdie’s rea-
              sonable expectation of privacy in his home.
     Moreover, the retention of the footage of the inside of Abdie’s
home and its later retrieval and review by other officers for investi-
gative purposes totally unrelated to the domestic disturbance that
occasioned its creation constituted an independent infringement of
Abdie’s reasonable expectation of privacy. In examining technolog-
ical advances that permit law enforcement to collect data that may
reveal private details about citizens’ lives, this Court has held that
both the collection of the data and its subsequent retention and
analysis are events of potential constitutional import that must be
separately analyzed. See, e.g., McCarthy, 484 Mass. at 506 (noting
constitutional implications of “one-year retention period” for li-
cense plate reader data); id. at 513 (Gants, C.J., concurring) (suggest-
ing that warrant may be required before police may analyze their
own lawfully collected data if such analysis would violate reasona-
ble expectations of privacy); Commonwealth v. Norman, 484 Mass.
330, 333 (2020), citing Commonwealth v. Johnson, 481 Mass. 710, 715
(2019) (even if initial collection of GPS data was constitutional, later
analysis of it may still require warrant); Commonwealth v. Arzola, 470
Mass. 809, 817–818 (2015), citing Maryland v. King, 569 U.S. 435, 464–
465 (2013) (DNA analysis of lawfully seized evidence could require
warrant depending on what information will be obtained). See also
Birchfield v. North Dakota, 136 S. Ct. 2160, 2178 (2016) (requiring war-


                                    23
rant for blood test but not breath test, in part because retention of
blood sample gives rise to “potential” for future testing that could
reveal private information, which “may result in anxiety”); Landry v.
Attorney General, 429 Mass. 336, 354 (1999) (“indefinite storage” of
DNA sample “creates some concern that the samples could be mis-
used at some point in the future”).
    The same is true here. The availability of video footage of the
inside of someone’s home for viewing and analysis by any police of-
ficer who believes it may, if studied carefully enough, furnish some
evidence of a crime, implicates serious privacy interests. The inva-
sion of privacy entailed by the Gang Unit’s acquisition and inspec-
tion of the bodycam footage was different both in degree and in
kind from that previously accomplished by another officer’s mere
presence in Abdie’s home. See Balicki, 436 Mass. at 11–12. See also Ca-
mara, 387 U.S. at 537 (search “aimed at the discovery of evidence of
crime” is more invasive). Indeed, the ability to slow down, enhance,
and magnify video footage potentially makes it possible for police
later to discover not only details about the inside of the home that
the officer who made the recording happened not to notice at the
time, but also those that he could not have noticed. See Karo, 468 U.S.
at 715 (search occurs when government uses surveillance technology
to obtain information about interior of home “that it could not have
otherwise obtained without a warrant”).
    The Gang Unit’s acquisition and inspection of the footage
therefore was itself a search requiring an independent constitution-
al justification. Given the absence of any exigency that would have
prevented the Gang Unit from obtaining a warrant, their warrant-


                                  24
less review of the footage violated the Fourth Amendment and art.
14. See Almonor, 482 Mass. at 47 n.15 (“As always, governmental con-
duct that invades reasonable expectations of privacy is ordinarily
not permitted without a warrant, regardless of how such an invasion
takes place”). Cf. Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, 392–393 (2014) (war-
rant required for search conducted at time of arrest if it entails “sub-
stantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond the arrest itself”).
    B. The recording of the inside of the Yusufs’ apartment was
       unconstitutional because it exceeded the scope of the per-
       mission granted to police to enter the home.
    “With few exceptions, the question whether a warrantless
search of a home is reasonable and hence constitutional must be an-
swered no.” Kyllo, 533 U.S. at 31. Accord, e.g., Commonwealth v. Kaep-
peler, 473 Mass. 396, 400–401 (2015). The actions of whatever police
officer entered and filmed the inside of the Yusufs’ home on Febru-
ary 10, 2017, therefore constituted a presumptively unlawful war-
rantless search, which the Commonwealth bore the burden of justi-
fying by showing that it fell within one of the few “jealously and
carefully drawn” exceptions to the warrant requirement. Common-
wealth v. Tuschall, 476 Mass. 581, 589 (2017), quoting Jones v. United
States, 357 U.S. 493, 499 (1958).
    The exception that applied to legitimize the officer’s entry into
Abdie’s home was that Abdie’s sister consented to it. There is no
question that she was empowered to invite the police into the home
that she also shared. See Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103, 109 (2006).
But it does not necessarily follow that the officer was thereby em-
powered to create, and preserve indefinitely, video documentation
of the inside of the Yusufs’ apartment. As discussed supra, the video


                                    25
recording of the officer’s search of the Yusufs’ home rendered that
search considerably more intrusive. And, as the motion judge
acknowledged (R43/A41), no one had consented to that enhanced
intrusion on the family’s privacy.
    “A search that is based on consent may not exceed the scope of
that consent.” Commonwealth v. Ortiz, 478 Mass. 820, 824 (2018), citing
Commonwealth v. Cantalupo, 380 Mass. 173, 178 (1980) (“Because con-
sent can legitimize what would otherwise be an unreasonable and
illegal search, a search with consent is reasonable and legal only to
the extent that the individual has consented”). And “[t]he scope of a
search is generally defined by its expressed object.” Florida v. Jimeno,
500 U.S. 248, 251 (1991). See also Jardines, 569 U.S. at 9 (“The scope of a
license—express or implied—is limited not only to a particular area
but also to a specific purpose”).
    The expressed object of the entry to which Abdie’s sister con-
sented was the removal of Abdie’s girlfriend from the house. The
officer’s use of a bodycam to film the entire interaction was not nec-
essary to accomplish that purpose. Certainly, no one would expect
another professional invited into the home to accomplish a particu-
lar task—a plumber, say, or a cable installer—to videotape the ser-
vice call without asking permission first. Cf. Jardines, 569 U.S. at 8 &
n.2 (absent a warrant, police have no lawful authority to do anything
that would not be “expected of ordinary visitors”). Just as, in
Jardines, the fact that the officer was lawfully permitted to approach
the front door and knock did not also permit him to conduct a dog
sniff on the front porch, 569 U.S. at 8–9, so too here, the fact that the
officer was lawfully permitted to enter the apartment to assist in de-


                                     26
fusing the situation inside did not also permit him to film it. See id. at
7 (“an officer’s leave to gather information is sharply circumscribed
when he steps off [public] thoroughfares and enters the Fourth
Amendment’s protected areas”).
    The additional intrusion on the sanctity of Abdie’s home that
was occasioned by the use of the bodycam exceeded the scope of his
sister’s consent, and therefore was unreasonable. See id. at 9 (“Con-
sent at a traffic stop to an officer’s checking out an anonymous tip
that there is a body in the trunk does not permit the officer to rum-
mage through the trunk for narcotics”). Accord, e.g., Commonwealth v.
Gray, 465 Mass. 330, 343–344 (2013) (“Although the police lawfully
entered the apartment based on Alecia’s consent, her consent did
not thereby give police further permission to conduct a search of the
premises”); Commonwealth v. Augello, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 105, 107 n.4,
S.C., 452 Mass. 1021 (2008) (“Allowing the police to enter the apart-
ment to speak with them is not the same as giving permission to
search the apartment”); Commonwealth v. Thomas, 67 Mass. App. Ct.
738, 741–742 (2006) (arrestee’s request for police to lock his door did
not permit them to search drawer in his bedroom for keys; scope of
permissible police activity “limited to acts reasonably necessary to
comply with the defendant’s oral request to lock the apartment”).
    Moreover, even if Abdie’s sister had given police permission to
film, it is far from apparent that such consent would be valid as to
the inside of Abdie’s bedroom. “The reasonableness of a consent
search ‘is in significant part a function of commonly held under-
standing about the authority that co-inhabitants may exercise in
ways that affect each other’s interests.’” Porter P., 456 Mass. at 262–


                                   27
263, quoting Randolph, 547 U.S. at 111. And while there is a common
understanding that one resident of a home may invite a visitor to
enter, few would expect such an invitee to roam throughout the
house and memorialize the contents of the other residents’ private
rooms for later perusal by his colleagues. Cf. Commonwealth v. Lopez,
458 Mass. 383, 399 (2010) (Gants, J., concurring) (discussing limita-
tions on individuals’ authority to consent to searches of parts of
their homes that are occupied by others). This transgression of the
“background social norms” that give shape to the broadly worded
text of the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, Jardines, 569 U.S. at 9,
rendered the filming of the inside of Abdie’s room (where, it may be
noted, his girlfriend was still getting dressed when the camera ar-
rived) unreasonable and unconstitutional.
    C. The filming was not justified by the other exceptions to the
       warrant requirement alluded to by the motion judge.
    The motion judge grounded his holding that the filming was
lawful in part on a kind of exigency analysis, opining that “[t]here
was no reasonable opportunity for, or any rational reason to re-
quire, the police to halt their efforts to control what could have been
a violent situation by seeking and obtaining consent—presumably
from all of the angry parties—to permit recording” (R49/A47). Re-
spect for the constitutional privacy interests of individuals in their
homes—where “all details are intimate details,” Kyllo, 533 U.S. at
37—would seem to be a sufficiently “rational reason” for requiring
police to obtain consent before filming the inside of someone’s
house. And exigent circumstances cannot justify an intrusion on the
privacy of the home absent probable cause of a crime, which no one



                                   28
has ever contended was present here. See Commonwealth v. Arias, 481
Mass. 604, 615 (2019). Nor was the officer confronted with an emer-
gency that required him and his camera (as opposed to other offic-
ers already on the scene) to intervene without delay.
    Moreover, even assuming that the circumstances confronting
the responding officers had been sufficient to trigger the emergency
aid or exigent circumstances doctrines, those exceptions to the war-
rant requirement are to be “narrowly construed.” Arias, 481 Mass. at
614–615. See also id. at 610 (“the search must not exceed the scope of
the emergency”). As noted supra, there was no need to record the
encounter in order to address the situation at hand; refraining from
filming the inside of the Yusufs’ home without their consent would
not have required police to “halt their efforts to control” the situa-
tion (R49/A47). Indeed, had none of the responding officers been
equipped with a bodycam, there is no reason to believe any part of
the encounter would have gone any differently. And any exigency
presented on February 10 certainly did not require indefinite reten-
tion of the recording, or warrantless access to it by other officers for
an entirely unrelated investigation.
    It has long been established that a search conducted pursuant
to any of the exceptions to the warrant requirement must be “strictly
circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation.” Ran-
dolph, 547 U.S. at 113 n.3, quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 393
(1978). See also Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 611 (1999), quoting Mary-
land v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 87 (1987) (“The purposes justifying a po-
lice search strictly limit the permissible extent of the search”). Both
this Court and the Appeals Court have repeatedly held unconstitu-


                                   29
tional any police action more intrusive than necessary to deal with
the emergency at hand. See, e.g., Kaeppeler, 473 Mass. at 403–405;
Gray, 465 Mass. at 345; Commonwealth v. Entwistle, 463 Mass. 205, 217
(2012); Commonwealth v. Suters, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 449, 457 (2016);
Commonwealth v. Sondrini, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 704, 706–707 (2000);
Commonwealth v. Bass, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 972, 974 (1987). And as dis-
cussed supra, the excessiveness of the intrusion here was substantial.
The motion judge erred by failing to recognize that fact.
    D. The public policy concerns animating the motion judge’s
       conclusion that the recording was lawful cannot justify
       programmatic suspicionless filming of the insides of peo-
       ple’s homes for general law enforcement purposes.
    The motion judge’s ruling was also motivated in part by his be-
lief that the public policy considerations underlying the use of body-
cams militate in favor of recording police interactions, even when
they occur in private homes. In the judge’s words, “[o]ne of the pur-
poses of the body-worn camera is to ensure that police act in ac-
cordance with the law under tense circumstances like these; the law
encourages, and does not prohibit, its use here” (R49–50/A47–48).
The judge cited no authority for the proposition that “the law en-
courages” police to record the insides of people’s homes during ser-
vice calls without notice or consent.
    As an initial matter, it is hardly self-evident that the public poli-
cy concerns driving the adoption of bodycams would be advanced
by a holding that police may record everything they see and hear,
archive those recordings forever, and review them whenever they
think it might be useful to any ongoing investigation. “The purpose
of body-worn-camera footage,” even on the motion judge’s account-


                                  30
ing, is not general crime detection or prevention, but instead “is for
use in the service of other key objectives of the program, such as
transparency, accountability, and public trust-building.” Patrolmen’s
Benevolent Ass’n of N.Y. v. De Blasio, 171 A.D.3d 636, 637 (2019). Accord
R50/A48 (describing purpose as ensuring lawfulness of police con-
duct). But if every encounter with a police officer may be recorded,
preserved forever, and later painstakingly analyzed in the hope that
it may furnish evidence of a crime unrelated to the encounter itself,
citizens may justifiably hesitate before calling police for assistance
or inviting them into their homes. Rather than furthering the “key
objectives” of “accountability” and “public trust-building,” id., the
motion judge’s holding actually may threaten to undermine them.
    In any event, general public policy considerations cannot trump
enumerated constitutional rights. See Wilson, 526 U.S. at 612 (“Were
such generalized ‘law enforcement objectives’ themselves sufficient
to trump the Fourth Amendment, the protections guaranteed by
that Amendment’s text would be significantly watered down”). Even
where a considered policy judgment is made by the Legislature, this
Court “must, as always, provide an independent review of the con-
stitutionality of the governmental conduct that is authorized by
statute.” Johnson, 481 Mass. at 723. And here, there is not even any
legislative authorization for the search at issue. Instead, there is
nothing more than a decision by the Boston Police Department to
equip certain officers with cameras, archive the footage “forever,”
and allow any officer to access it upon request if they believe it rele-
vant to an investigation (M.108,110).




                                   31
    “The right of privacy was deemed too precious to entrust to the
discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime and the arrest
of criminals.” McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 455–456 (1948).
This is why “the Constitution requires a magistrate to pass on the
desires of the police before they violate the privacy of the home.” Id.
at 456. The judge gave no reason why the Gang Unit’s inspection of
the bodycam footage—which “reveal[ed] a critical fact about the in-
terior of [Abdie’s home] that the Government [was] extremely inter-
ested in knowing and that it could not have otherwise obtained
without a warrant,” Karo, 468 U.S. at 715—should be exempted from
this fundamental principle. Cf. Johnson, 481 Mass. at 715 (separately
analyzing reasonableness both of initial imposition of GPS monitor-
ing, and of “subsequent review of the historical GPS location data
for investigatory purposes”). In fact, as noted supra, he did not con-
duct any reasoned analysis of that inspection at all.
    The motion judge’s holding essentially permits police to con-
duct warrantless, suspicionless searches, for general criminal inves-
tigative purposes, of any home any officer equipped with a bodycam
has ever entered, in the guise of a program to enhance police trans-
parency, accountability, and public trust. But this Court has made
clear that “programmatic, suspicionless searches” are permissible
“only when [they] minimally invad[e] already diminished expecta-
tions of privacy.” Commonwealth v. Feliz, 481 Mass. 689, 699 (2019).
Far from a “minimal” invasion of an “already diminished” expecta-
tion of privacy, the Gang Unit’s review of footage of the inside of
Abdie’s bedroom was a significant intrusion on the sanctity of his
home—the area where his reasonable expectation of privacy is at its


                                  32
zenith. The judge’s failure to grapple with that fact fatally under-
mines his scant legal analysis.
    It may well be that the public policy considerations identified
by the judge could justify filming the police action at issue here. But
they could only do so if the subsequent use of the footage was strict-
ly limited to the non–law enforcement purposes underlying the
bodycam program. In that case, the filming potentially could be jus-
tified under the “special needs” exception to the warrant require-
ment. See, e.g., Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 873 (1987). The hall-
mark of that exception is the existence of “special needs, beyond the
normal need for law enforcement, [that] make the warrant and
probable-cause requirement impracticable.” Id., quoting New Jersey
v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 351 (1985) (Blackmun, J., concurring). The use-
fulness of bodycam footage in ensuring law enforcement accounta-
bility could, perhaps, qualify as such a “special need.”
    But the essence of the special needs doctrine is a need that is
“divorced from the State’s general interest in law enforcement.” Fer-
guson v. Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 79 (2001). Hence the holding that
“warrantless searches are typically unreasonable where ‘a search is
undertaken by law enforcement officials to discover evidence of
criminal wrongdoing.’” Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2221, quoting Vernonia
School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–653 (1995). Programmatic
searches that are conducted without a warrant supported by proba-
ble cause may not constitutionally be “turned into ‘a purposeful and
general means of discovering evidence of crime.’” Florida v. Wells,
495 U.S. 1, 4 (1990), quoting Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U.S. 367, 376 (1987)
(Blackmun, J., concurring). Compare, e.g., Acton, 515 U.S. at 658 (drug


                                    33
testing of students permissible because test results “disclosed only
to a limited class of school personnel who have a need to know,” are
“not turned over to law enforcement authorities or used for any in-
ternal disciplinary function”), with Ferguson, 532 U.S. at 83 (warrant-
less drug testing of hospital patients unconstitutional where pro-
gram “generat[ed] evidence for law enforcement purposes”).
    Abdie assumes arguendo that the need to “ensure that police act
in accordance with the law” (R50/A48), which the judge concluded
was the bodycam program’s purpose, could be “important enough
to override [his] privacy interest” in not having his bedroom filmed
without his express consent. Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 318
(1997). Even so, the objectively reasonable expectation of the public
logically should be that footage generated through that program
will be put to use only for that purpose. See Commonwealth v. Buccel-
la, 434 Mass. 473, 485 (2001) (citizens reasonably expect that materi-
als gathered by government for particular purposes will be used
“solely for the purposes intended and not disclos[ed] to others in
ways that are unconnected with those intended purposes”). Compare
Johnson, 481 Mass. at 727–728 (probationer should reasonably expect
GPS data to be used “to deter and detect criminal activity during the
probationary period,” but “indiscriminate rummaging” in that data
“might raise different, more difficult constitutional questions about
objective expectations of privacy, even for a probationer”).
    This is not to say that, if police have good reason to think that
particular bodycam footage contains evidence pertinent to an unre-
lated investigation, they never can get access to that footage. It is
merely to say that before they may do so, their “obligation is a famil-


                                  34
iar one—get a warrant.” Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2221. Given the seri-
ous intrusion on the sanctity of the home occasioned by ready po-
lice access to such footage, this is hardly an unreasonable require-
ment. There has been no suggestion that “the burden of obtaining a
warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the
search.” Camara, 387 U.S. at 533. Nor could there be; where the foot-
age has already been retained and archived, interposition of a neu-
tral magistrate between that footage and general law enforcement
“rummaging,” Johnson, 481 Mass. at 727, would not frustrate the ob-
jectives of any well-grounded search.

                            CONCLUSION
    The unauthorized creation, retention, and analysis of video
footage of the inside of Abdie’s bedroom intruded on his reasonable
expectation of privacy. Because no warrant was obtained and no ex-
ception to the warrant requirement applies, his motion to suppress
that footage and its fruits should have been allowed.

                                        Respectfully submitted,

                MEMORANDUM DEFENDANTS* MOTION TO SUPPRESS


        The defendant, Abirahman Yusuf ("Abdie"), is charged with firearm offenses arising from

the seizure by Boston Police of a firearm and ammunition following execution of a search

warrant at his residence located at 1 Ames Street, Apartment 1, Dorchester ("the Apartment").

His brother, Yusuf Yusuf ("Yusuf), is charged with possession of ammunition and possession of

a Class D substance with intent to distribute, also arising from the search. The defendants raise

several claims in connection with their motions to suppress the result of the search:

       Franks/Amral: Abdie claims that he is entitled to a hearing under either Franks v.

Delaware. 438 U.S. 154 (1978) or Commonwealth v. Amral. 407 Mass. 511, 522-23 (1990)

because (1) the affiant of the search warrant affidavit omitted mention of numerous Field

Interrogation/Observation Reports (FlOs) which showed that Abdie was not in possession of

guns on dates before the search, the omission of which misled the magistrate; and (2) the

affiant's allegation in the search warrant affidavit that Abdie was likely in possession of a "real"

firearm was false or misleading.

       Suppression of Evidence Seized Pursuant to a Search Warrant: Abdie moves to

suppress the results of the search warrant on several grounds: (1) that the warrant was based on



1

                                                A37
footage of the Apartment improperly taken with a body-worn camera and improperly preserved

by police; (2) that the warrant was based on videos posted by Abdie on a popular cellular phone

application called SnapChat which were improperly accessed and improperly recorded; and (3)

that since the warrant did not permit photographs to be taken during the execution of the warrant,

all such photographs should be suppressed.

          Standing: To the extent he has standing, Yusuf seeks to join in Abdie's suppression

motion.


          Miranda issue: Abdie argues that statements he made at booking should be suppressed

as the fruits of the illegality mentioned above or because they were taken in violation of

Miranda.


         An evidentiary hearing on the motion was conducted on September 5, 2018, after which

Yusuf submitted a supplemental memorandum.' In light of the arguments made by counsel and

the facts presented, and for the reasons stated below, the defendants' motions are DENIED.

                                            FINDINGS OF FACT


         Boston Police Detective Brian Ball testified. I fully credit his testimony. Ball is a

detective in the Youth Violence Task Force, colloquially known as the Gang Unit. He has been a

police officer with the Boston Police for almost 16 years, has spent some 2.5 years in the Gang

Unit, and specializes in collecting firearm and other evidence in support of cases brought by the

Gang Unit through the application for search warrants and otherwise.

         In January 2017, the Gang Unit was engaged in an investigation of Abdie, a suspected

gang member, and had collected information that Abdie unlawfully possessed firearms. Ball

1 At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court directed the Commonwealth to produce, in camera, the SnaoChat
identity that its officer used to access Abdie's SnapChat account to determine whether the defense was entitled to
further discovery of that information and to assess the Amral claim. After review of that information, the Court has
determined that no further discovery is warranted.

                                                        A38
became involved in the investigation shortly thereafter, and began monitoring Abdie's SnapChat

account. SnapChat is an application used typically with cellular telephones in which users can

take photographs and record videos and share them with other users to whom the SnapChat user

has granted access as "friends." Ball requested such access in late 2016 or early 2017 using an

undercover account and undercover identity. The undercover identity did not use Ball's real

name or identify Ball as a police officer; instead, it used a fictitious nickname and substituted an

"emoji," a digital cartoon, for a photograph of that user. Abdie, who used the name "dee.fazo"

on SnapChat, granted Ball access through this account. Thereafter, Ball monitored the posts on

SnapChat that Abdie allowed him to see. While SnapChat videos are usually automatically

deleted after 24 hours, others which are posted on the "My Story" portion of the site are not

automatically deleted and remain available to the user's "friends" until the user removes them or

takes some other action to limit access to them. Ball reviewed those videos and preserved them

by playing them with one cellular telephone and recording them using another cellular phone.

        Before Ball began monitoring Abdie's SnapChat account, at least two other Boston Police

officers had done so since about June 2016. Ball testified that those other officers who


monitored Abdie's SnapChat account before him did so following the same procedure that he had

followed - using a pseudonym to request Abdie's permission to access his SnapChat account,

which Abdie provided. The parties stipulated that Boston Police had viewed and recorded 27

SnapChat videos from Abdie's account, which were dated between June 2016 and February of

2017. Ball reviewed these videos. Several of them showed Abdie with firearms. Indeed, Ball

was brought into the investigation to assist the officers in gathering sufficient evidence to

establish probable cause to search Abdie for the firearms because there were so many of them in




3

                                                A39
the videos and the officers (and later Ball) believed the firearms displayed by Abdie were real

firearms, not replicas.

        After Ball "friended" Abdie, he frequently checked his SnapChat for posts, as Abdie

frequently posted videos. Ball did not save all of the videos he watched. Many were of Abdie

walking down streets smoking marijuana, which Ball decided were of no evidentiary value, but

he deemed others to be significant and recorded them. Some of the videos which were saved

were introduced into evidence. They show Abdie displaying guns. One such video includes the

caption "I got mine on me too." Another includes the caption "Watch who you call bro." These

posts do not appear to be targeted at Abdie's friends, but rather appear to be threats directed at

Abdie's rivals, presumably in other gangs, who may be viewing the videos.

       On February 25,2017, Ball viewed a video on Abdie's SnapChat account, which was

entered into evidence. It showed Abdie in what appeared to be a bedroom with a gun. Ball was

familiar with Abdie and recognized him in the video. The video showed that it had been posted

on February 25. SnapChat videos are typically created and posted at the same time. SnapChat

reflects the time a video is posted, which typically corresponds to when the video was created.

Although it is possible to record a video and post it later, SnapChat videos often provide

evidence that this was the case - in most cases, there would be a camera roll icon in the video,

showing that the video was posted from the user's archives. Ball did not see this icon in the

video posted on February 25 and saw no evidence to suggest the video was created and posted

earlier than on February 25. As noted above, it was not unusual that Abdie was displaying a gun

during a SnapChat video, as he had done so several times over the previous several months.

However, Ball noticed a distinctive curtain in the background of the video.

                                                A40
          Ball was aware that a few weeks previously, on February 10, 2017, Boston Police had

been called to Abdie's apartment for a domestic disturbance. An officer responding to the call

was wearing a body camera. Body-worn cameras of the type used on February 10, 2017, are

worn on the chest of the officer, and emit an audible beep and red light. The footage from that

camera was preserved by Boston Police and by Ball.^ A video of that footage was entered into

evidence. It showed Boston Police officers entering the Apartment, in which both Abdie and

Yusuf lived. No one at the Apartment gave permission to the police to use the body-worn

camera. The scene inside was chaotic: two women from the first floor were yelling at and about

Abdie and a woman, evidently his girlfriend, on the second floor. The women on the first floor

wanted Abdie's girlfnend to leave, but continued yelling about the situation and at the police as

the offices tried to remove the girlfnend from the Apartment. As part of that effort, the police

interacted with Abdie outside of his bedroom, which was depicted in the video. In Abdie's

bedroom hung the same curtain Ball had seen in the SnapChat video. From this. Ball determined

that there was probable cause to believe that Abdie had possessed the firearm in the SnapChat

video in his bedroom, and did so on February 25.

         Because that video showed the location at which Abdie possessed the firearm. Ball

focused on it in preparing a search warrant affidavit. On February 27, 2017, Ball applied for and

obtained a search warrant for the Apartment. In the search warrant affidavit. Ball noted that the

guns Abdie possessed in a number of SnapChat videos were real because Abdie "has been

observed on several occasions loading firearms with ammunition," which showed the guns were


2 Another officer, Sergeant Detective John Broderick, became aware of the video from a body-worn camera that
related to the Apartment when he saw a call for service at that location and determined that one of the officers was
wearing a camera. He requested the footage and said that as far as he knew, the body-worn camera video relied
upon in the search warrant affidavit was saved permanently by Boston Police, but could only be accessed if it was
requested in an investigation.

                                                        A41
not replicas. Further, Ball is an experienced detective who has used, seized, seen and handled

firearms and been involved in firearm investigation for some 16 years, and Ball believed the

firearms Abdie possessed in the SnapChat videos were real based on their appearance. The

affidavit also noted that Abdie was an active member of the Franklin Field gang, had been active

in gang violence and firearm activities, and on February 14, 2017, had posted "a video of himself

in a rival gang's territory" on SnapChat, minutes after which there was a shooting in that area.^

Shortly after the shooting, Abdie posted a video on SnapChat alluding to the shooting. Further,

on February 17,2017, officers believed Abdie had a gun when he exited 1 Ames Street and

entered a car. When officers tried to stop the vehicle, it escaped at a high rate of speed. The

affidavit added that Abdie was neither licensed to carry a firearm nor old enough to do so.

               Prior to the search, Abdie was subject to several Field Interrogation Observation ("FIG")

interactions with the police, in which he came into contact with the police. The police

documented these encounters in FIG Reports.'^ In none of those interactions were firearms seized

from Abdie. Abdie had also posted numerous videos showing him in possession of firearms, but

none had been recovered from him. Ball did not include these facts in the search warrant


a f fi d a v i t .


              The search warrant was executed on March 2,2017. The warrant and supporting

affidavit were submitted into evidence. Ball took part in the execution of the warrant. During

the search, officers recovered a firearm and found narcotics throughout the apartment. They


3 As part of his claim for a Franks/Amral hearing, Abdie claims that the affidavit described this shooting as
"confirmed" but that police reports did not yield ballistics or evidence of it. Abdie, however, submitted no evidence
on this point. The Court thus does not address it.


4 See, e.g.. Commonwealth v. Warren. 475 Mass. 530, 532 n. 5 (2016) (citation omitted) ("'A "field interrogation
observation" (FIO) has been described as an interaction in which a police officer identifies an individual and finds
out that person's business for being in a particular area.' FIOs are deemed consensual encounters because the
individual approached remains free to terminate the conversation at will").

found ammunition and marijuana in what they understood to be Yusuf s bedroom. Yusuf and

Abdie were arrested at the scene. The search warrant did not seek to seize the curtains in Abdie's

bedroom, and they were not seized. Photographs were taken during the search, but were not

listed on the search warrant return.


       Sergeant Detective John Broderick testified. I fully credit his testimony. Broderick has

25 years of experience with the Boston Police Department. He was part of the team that

executed the search warrant at the Apartment on March 2, 2017. There were five to eight people

in the apartment, including Abdie and Yusuf. Broderick showed the warrant to the parents of

Abdie and Yusuf and explained what the officers were doing. He then read all of the occupants,

who had been gathered in the living room, their Miranda rights from a Miranda card, reading the

warnings line by line. Yusuf and Abdie were present while he did so. Neither made any

statements. Broderick was not present at the booking of Abdie and Yusuf. Broderick did not

think Abdie's demeanor was confrontational, although Abdie was upset. Yusuf was calm and

cooperative.

       Detective Stephen Ridge testified. I fully credit his testimony. Ridge has been a Boston

Police Officer for 25 years, 16 of them as a detective. On March 2, 2017, he was present during

the booking of Yusuf and Abdie. They were booked at the same time. Each was searched and

asked booking questions. During that process, Abdie told the booking officer not to charge

Yusuf with ammunition because "it was mine." Abdie also said he was glad the police only

found one gun, and glad that "I got that sh-t out of there." These statements were unprompted

by any questions. Ridge described Abdie's demeanor as gentlemanly when he claimed the

ammunition was his, but "fresh" when he claimed that the police failed to seize more weapons.

        The defense called Daniel Loper. Loper is a consultant in digital forensics. In that role,

he analyzes computers, laptops, and cellphones for digital content. He has conducted

investigations involving SnapChat for over 3 to 4 years and was familiar with SnapChat's

security settings. He testified that a user can post videos on SnapChat and select the "friends"

who are permitted to see it, or post the video on the "My Story" section, which he claimed would

automatically delete after 24 hours. He added that the "My Story" settings can limit access to

videos to a select number of "friends," but that if a "friend" could view the video, that friend had

access to it.


                                   CONCLUSIONS         OF   LAW


        1. Standing


        Yusuf is charged with the possession of drugs and ammunition. For possessory offenses,

a charged defendant has automatic standing to challenge the seizure. Commonwealth v.

Amendola. 406 Mass. 592, 601 (1990) ("[w]hen a defendant is charged with a crime in which

possession of the seized evidence at the time of the contested search is an essential element of

guilt, the defendant shall be deemed to have standing to contest the legality of the search and the

seizure of that evidence"); Commonwealth v. Frazier. 410 Mass. 235, 243 (1991) ("[t]he

dispositive issue in determining whether a defendant has automatic standing is whether

'possession of the seized evidence at the time of the contested search is an essential element of

guilt'"). In addition, however, such a party must allege a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Commonwealth v. Mubdi. 456 Mass. 385, 391 (2010), citing Frazier. 410 Mass. at 244 n.3 ("the

question of standing remains separate from the question of reasonable expectation of privacy").

"Where the defendant has automatic standing, the defendant need not show that he has a

reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched," just "that someone had a reasonable




8

                                               A44
expectation of privacy in the place searched, because only then would probable cause, reasonable

suspicion, or consent be required to justify the search." Mubdi. 456 Mass. at 392-93 (citations

omitted) (emphasis added).

        Since the evidence is that Yusuf and Abdie lived in the same address, and that the

ammunition with which Yusuf is charged was claimed by Abdie at booking as his own, Yusuf has

standing to join in Abdie's motion to suppress. Commonwealth v. Lawson. 79 Mass. App. Ct.

322, 326 (2011)) (defendant may assert the constitutional rights of someone involved with his

allegedly criminal conduct), overruled in part on other grounds. Commonwealth v. Campbell.

475 Mass. 611, 617 n.9 (2016).

        2.   Franks/Amral


        Abdie is not entitled to a hearing under either Franks v. Delaware. 438 U.S. 154 (1978) or

Commonwealth v. Amral. 407 Mass. 511, 522-23 (1990).

        Under Franks.


       where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement
       knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the
       affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the
       finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the
       defendant's request. In the event that at that hearing the allegation of perjury or reckless
       disregard is established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, and, with
       the affidavit's false material set to one side, the affidavit's remaining content is
       insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits
       of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of
       the affidavit.


438 U.S. at 155-156. "Thus, judicial inquiry into the veracity of the underlying facts contained

in a search warrant affidavit is limited to whether the affidavit did in fact contain misstatements


by the affiant and whether the misstatements were made intentionally or with reckless disregard

for the truth." Amral. 407 Mass. at 520 (citation omitted).

       Under Amral.




                                                A45
        the Supreme Judicial Court held that a defendant, under a less stringent test than Franks,
        may be entitled to an m camera hearing to determine whether he or she must receive a
        Franks hearing. The court held "that the public interest in deterring police misconduct
        requires the trial judge to exercise his or her discretion to order an in camera hearing
        where the defendant by affidavit asserts facts which cast a reasonable doubt on the
        veracity of material representations made by the affiant concerning a confidential
        informant.


Commonwealth v. DeMatos. 77 Mass. App. Ct. 727, 733-34 (2010). Material omissions of fact,

as opposed to affirmative misstatements, may also justify an Amral hearing. Commonwealth v.

Ramos, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 773, 778 (2008).

        In this case, the defendant here has not satisfied his substantial preliminary showing that

the affidavit contains any false statement, misstatement or material omission that were the result

of perjury or recklessness, nor has he shown any facts which cast a reasonable doubt on the

veracity of the material representations that were made in the affidavit. Abdie's claim that the

police misled the magistrate by not disclosing the FIOs showing that Abdie was not in possession

of firearms on prior occasions is not a material omission. The fact that a suspect has not

previously been found to be committing a crime, here illegal possession of firearms, would rarely

be necessary to include in an affidavit to satisfy the Franks or Amral standards, and certainly was

not necessary in this case. Commonwealth v. Luce, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 105, 111 (1993) ("An

affiant who sets out information adding up to probable cause to make a search is not bound to

recite investigative efforts that did not pan out"). Indeed, the fact that the police had failed to

find Abdie in personal possession of firearms in the past bolstered the conclusion that he was

hiding them somewhere, and made more likely, not less likely, that they would be found in his

residence. The facts regarding the previous FIOs also showed that Abdie was subject to frequent

contact with the police and thus had reason to conceal the guns that he clearly possessed on the

SnapChat videos somewhere other than on his person, such as within his residence. In short, the




1 0

                                                 A46
omission of the FIO facts simply did not undermine Bail's conclusion that Abdie was keeping

guns in his bedroom, but rather enhanced that conclusion.

        To the extent that Abdie claims there is a need for a Franks or Amral hearing on the

ground that Ball's assertion that the firearms he was filmed with were real was somehow false,

the Court finds that claim meritless. Ball was highly experienced with firearms and had a good

faith basis for concluding that the guns he had seen in the videos were not replicas, including that

in the SnapChat videos, Abdie loaded firearms, that they appeared real, and that Abdie taunted

rival gangs, all of which made it likely that Abdie was handling actual weapons. Further, Abdie

has adduced no facts suggesting that replicas played any role in this case - and only a real

firearm, and no replicas, were seized during the search itself.

        3. Suppression of Search

        A. Bodv-Wom Camera Use and Preservation


        Abdie claims that his rights to privacy were violated when officers responding to his

home wore a body-worn camera and did not receive permission from anyone in the Apartment to

do so. He also argues that the Boston Police's preservation and use of that footage also violated

his rights.

        Abdie cites to no case that supports his claim that a police officer wearing a body camera

during a visit to his home ten days prior to the warrant violated his rights. Even if there were

some right to notice and consent to such recording, it would seem inapplicable here. The police

were called to the Apartment for a domestic disturbance and encountered a chaotic scene. There

was no reasonable opportunity for, or any rational reason to require, the police to halt their

efforts to control what could have been a violent situation by seeking and obtaining consent -

presumably from all of the angry parties - to permit recording. One of the purposes of the body-




1 1

                                                A47
worn camera is to ensure that police act in accordance with the law under tense circumstances

like these; the law encourages, and does not prohibit, its use here.®

         Abdie's claim that the police had no right to preserve the footage is also unsupported by

any law on point. The police did not exceed the scope of their purpose while they were inside

the Apartment - they were properly present in the home and photographed only what they saw in

fulfilling their duties. Abdie relies on Commonwealth v. Balicki. 436 Mass. 1 (2002) in support

of his claims, but the situation here is different from that at issue in Balicki. In that case, the

government exceeded the scope of a warrant by inspecting items in every room of a residence,

all the while photographing and videotaping the items:

         While such a search would have been improper even without the use of the video
         and still cameras, their use not only documented the offending nature of the
         search, it also contributed to its intrusiveness. It is one thing to be present in a
         home carrying out the directives of a warrant, and of necessity being in a position
         cursorily to notice many of its contents. It is quite another to inspect the contents
         of a home and to create a permanent record of it for inspection by police,
         prosecutors, expert witnesses, and others at any time in the future. This record can
         be played and replayed as many times as necessary or desired, and the images can
         be focused or enlarged to show each detail of every item in that citizen's home.
         The use of videotape and photographs in this case goes far beyond the limited
         photographic preservation of the condition of a search scene (to protect the police
         from allegations of damage), or the photographic preservation of evidence, in situ,
         that the police otherwise have the right to seize pursuant to a warrant or any
         exception thereto. Such limited intrusions are not offensive to the privacy interests
         protected by art. 14. This search, and the use of the videotape and photographs to
         document it, was.

         We do not agree with the Commonwealth that the officers acted properly because
         they videotaped and photographed only that which was in plain view. The fact
         that the officers seized certain items pursuant to the plain view doctrine does not
         mean that the Commonwealth can extend that rationale to support a general

5 Yusuf cited to the Boston Police Department's policy governing the use of body-worn cameras, but did not
produce this policy in evidence. Even were the Court to take judicial notice of it, it would not aid the defendants'
claims. The policy does not require officers to obtain consent to record using the devices in exigent circumstances.
The Court finds that the circumstances within the Apartment on February 10 were exigent. Brigham City. Utah
V. Stuart. 547 U.S. 398,403-06 (2006) ("One exigency obviating the requirement of a warrant is the need to assist
persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury... The role of a peace officer includes preventing
violence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to casualties").

        exploratory search of the home, photographing or videotaping anything they
        might find to be interesting or suspicious.

Balicki. 436 Mass. at 11-13 (citations, footnotes omitted). In the absence of further guidance

from the Appeals or Supreme Judicial Courts, the police properly took the video, retained it and

used it in the subsequent investigation.

        B. SnapChat Access and Preservation


        Abdie argues that he has an expectation of privacy in his SnapChat account, without

which he cannot show that a search even occurred. Under these facts, he did not have an

expectation of privacy.

        "For a search to have taken place, the defendant must have had a subjective expectation

of privacy, and that expectation must have been one that society recognizes as objectively

reasonable." Commonwealth v. Pina. 406 Mass. 540, 544 (1990), citing Katz v. United States.

389 U.S. 347, 360 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). In the abstract, the question as to whether

and to what extent a user of a social media account has a reasonable expectation of privacy poses

difficult questions in light of the fact that the communications are maintained by a third party,

and not the user himself or herself. Compare United States v. Miller. 425 U.S. 435,443 (1976)

(bank customer had no reasonable expectation of privacy over certain banking records held by a

third party, the bank) Smith v. Marvland. 442 U.S. 735, 741-42 (1979) (telephone subscriber had

no reasonable expectation of privacy over numbers dialed using a telephone and communicated

to the telephone companvl with Carpenter v. United States. 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018) (an individual

maintains an expectation of privacy in cell-cite location records maintained by a third party, the

cell phone service carrier). Yet even assuming a SnapChat user has an expectation of privacy if,

as was the case here, he or she limits access to his or her account, Abdie's claim nonetheless fails

on these facts.




13

                                                A49
        At the outset, Abdie argues he excluded people from having access to his SnapChat

account whom he did not "know personally," but submitted no evidence to support this claim.

There is thus no basis to conclude that he, in fact, had a subjective expectation of privacy of that

account and, accordingly, that any "search" occurred. S^, ^., Commonwealth v. Netto. 438

Mass. 686, 697 (2003) (citations omitted) ("the burden is initially on the defendants to

demonstrate that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy .. .It is not the Commonwealth's

burden to show that there was no such reasonable expectation of privacy at that time. Thus, if the

record is unclear .. .it is the defendants—^not the Commonwealth—^who have failed to meet their

burden of proof, as they are the ones who must show that a 'search' in the constitutional sense

occurred").

       Leaving this concern aside, Abdie's claim would fail on other factual grounds. In this

case, the government contends that Abdie gave them consent to access his account. The

government can obtain consent to receive otherwise private communications by using informers

or undercover posing as criminal confederates of a suspect. S^, ^., Hoffa v. United States. 385

U.S. 293, 302-03 (1966) (no Fourth Amendment right violated where government used a

cooperating witness who reported incriminating statements made by the petitioner; cooperator

was present "with petitioner's consent," and petitioner took the risk that the cooperator would not

maintain his confidence); Lewis v United States. 385 U.S. 206,208 (1966) ("[I]n the detection of

many types of crime, the Government is entitled to use decoys and to conceal the identity of its

agents"). In contrast, the government generally cannot validly obtain consent to access private

locations where that consent is based on the government agent's posing as a law-abiding private

citizen; for instance, if the police gain access to a house while posing as a gas company

employee searching for a gas leak, the consent is unlawful. S^, e^.. United States v. Giraldo.




1 4

                                                A50
743 R Supp. 152, 153 (E.D.N.Y.1990) (invalid consent to enter residence where a police officer

pretended to work for the gas company and told the defendant she was checking for a gas leak).

In this case. Ball used neither of these approaches; he did not pose as a criminal or as a person

with some legitimate claim to access, like a SnapChat service representative, but instead used a

false name and emoji image, plainly concealing his true identity. Abdie did not grant access to

his SnapChat because he believed Ball was a criminal confederate or a service-provider of some

type, he provided access to a complete stranger.^ Abdie thus assumed the risk that the user might

be friend or foe. The Court infers the reason for this; at least some of the videos do not appear to

be communications aimed at friends but threats targeted at rival gangs, warning them that Abdie

was armed and dangerous and was actively encroaching on their "territory," and that Abdie

granted access to his SnapChat account to unknown persons because he wanted to disseminate

his threatening message to rival gang members who had reason to conceal their identities from

him. Under these facts, Abdie did not have a subjective or a reasonable expectation of privacy in

the SnapChat videos simply because they were not private at all. Abdie did not take "normal

precautions to protect his privacy." Pma, 406 Mass. at 545. This case is thus similar to

Commonwealth v. D'Onofrio. 396 Mass. 711 (1986). There the Supreme Judicial Court found

that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by misrepresenting their identities in order

to infiltrate private club where the club did not enforce a policy to exclude the public:

         To establish a reasonable expectation of privacy, it is not enough for the
         defendants to show that they had an unenforced "policy" of restricting access to

6 Since the police had consent to receive the SnapChat communications, their warrantless monitoring of the
SnapChat account did not violate federal or state wiretap law. See 18 U.S.C. §2511(c) ("It shall not be unlawful
under this chapter for a person acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication,
where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior
consent to such interception"); G.L. c. 272, §99(B)(4) ("The term 'interception' means to secretly hear, secretly
record, or aid another to secretly hear or secretly record the contents of any wire or oral communication through the
use of any intercepting device by any person other than a person given prior authority by all parties to such
communication").

                                                         A51
       [the club] to members and guests of members. In Commonwealth v. Simmons.
       392 Mass. 45, 50 (1984), we noted the relevancy to "the expectation of privacy
       calculus" of "whether the defendant 'took normal precautions to maintain his
       privacy—^that is, precautions customarily taken by those seeking privacy.'..." We
       said in Commonwealth v. Cadoret 388 Mass. [148,] at 151 [(1983)], that
       "[f]ailure to enforce limitations on admittance would warrant the conclusion that
       the persons operating the club had no reasonable expectation of privacy." That
       conclusion is required in the absence of reasonable enforcement efforts.... In the
       absence of evidence that the defendants made reasonable efforts to corroborate the
       claims of guest status made by persons seeking admission to the club, the
       evidence fails to show that the public was not freely admitted there. If the public
       was freely admitted, the defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of
       privacy, and [the officer's] entrance into the club and observations of things in
       plain view did not violate the defendants' Fourth Amendment rights.

D'Onofrio. 396 Mass. at 716-17 (citations omitted). That Abdie accepted a request from a user

who was unknown to him undercuts his argument that he relied on the safeguards that he put in

place to protect his privacy as it pertains to his SnapChat posts. S^, ^., Everett v. State of

Delaware. 186 A.3d 1224,1236 (Del. 2018) ("[T]he Fourth Amendment does not guard against

the risk that the person from whom one accepts a 'friend request' and to whom one voluntar[ily]

disclosed such information might turn out to be an undercover officer or a 'false friend'");

United States v. Gatson. No. 13-705, 2014 WL 7182275, at *22 (D.N.J. 2014) (no search

warrant required for police officer to use undercover account to become Instagram "friends" with

defendant); United States v. Mereeildo. 883 F. Supp. 2d 523, 525-526 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (social

media user's "legitimate expectation of privacy ended when he disseminated posts to his

'friends' because those 'friends' were free to use the information however they wanted -

including sharing it with the Government"). Even had Abdie subjectively believed that his

SnapChat communications were private, a conclusion belied by his apparent intent for his videos

to broadcast threats to others not closely associated with him, that belief is not reasonable under

these circumstances where he did not enforce a privacy policy and mistakenly relied upon the

trustworthiness of a SnapChat user whose identity he did not know. S^ Pina. 406 Mass. at 544-



1 6

                                                A52
545; D'Onofrio. 396 Mass. at 716-718; also Hoffa. 385 U.S. at 303, quoting Lopez v. United

States. 373 U.S. 427,465 (1963) (Brennan, J., dissenting) ("The risk of being... betrayed by an

informer or deceived as to the identity of one with whom one deals is probably inherent in the

conditions of human society" and "is the kind of risk we necessarily assume whenever we

speak"). There may be a case in which a social media user's expectation of privacy in his or her

communications to others is reasonable under other factual circumstances, but here the facts do

not support a conclusion that a search took place in the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and

art. 14. Pina, 406 Mass. at 544.

       Abdie's claim that the police improperly recorded the SnapChat videos that were posted

on his SnapChat account fails for the same reasons as his complaint that the body-wom camera

footage should not have been preserved - that no law prohibited the police from taking the video

and preserving it thereafter. See Balicki. 436 Mass. at 13 n. 13 ("We need not decide in this case

whether the videotaping and photographing of a proper search would be unconstitutional"). Nor

did the recording exceed the scope of Abdie's consent. "A search that is based on consent may

not exceed the scope of that consent. The standard for measuring the scope of a suspect's

consent under the Fourth Amendment is that of 'objective' reasonableness—^what would the

typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect?"

Commonwealth v. Ortiz. 478 Mass. 820, 824 (2018) (citations, internal punctuation omitted).

Under this standard, "the focus is solely on what a typical reasonable person would understand

the scope of the consent to be, based on the words spoken and the context in which they are

spoken, not on what a police officer may understand." Id, 478 Mass. at 824. A reasonable

person in Abdie's position would have understood that giving access to the SnapChat account

allowed viewers to use a number of readily-available techniques to preserve those videos.




1 7

                                               A53
        Because the facts from SnapChat and the body camera were properly included in the

search warrant affidavit, the information from those sources is properly considered in

determining if the affidavit establishes probable cause.

       An inquiry into the sufficiency of a search warrant application always begins and ends

with the "four comers of the affidavit." Commonwealth v. Barbosa. 92 Mass. App. Ct. 1114

(2017) (Rule 1:28 decision), citing Commonwealth v. O'Dav. 440 Mass. 296, 297 (2003). When

reviewing a warrant for probable cause, a judge must determine whether, based on the affidavit

in its entirety, the magistrate had a substantial basis to conclude that a crime had been committed,

that the items described in the warrant were related to the criminal activity, and that those items

would probably be located in the place to be searched. Commonwealth v. O'Dav. 440 Mass.

296, 298 (2003). In addition,

       [t]his probable cause inquiry requires a "nexus between the items to be seized and
       the place to be searched." When the place to be searched is a residence, "there
       must be specific information in the affidavit, and reasonable inferences a
       magistrate may draw, to provide 'a sufficient nexus between the defendant's drug-
       selling activity and [her] residence to establish probable cause to search the
       residence.'" To satisfy this "nexus" requirement, and thus the probable cause
       standard, the affidavit "must provide a substantial basis for concluding that
       evidence connected to the crime will be found on the specified premises." ...
       [EJven "[a] single observation of a suspect leaving [her] home for a dmg deal may
       also support an inference that drugs will be found in the home where it is coupled
       with other information."


Commonwealth v. Tania. 463 Mass. 721, 725-26 (2012) (citations omitted).

        Here the affidavit established probable cause to believe that Abdie had a gun inside the

Apartment. The SnapChat video was taken within 72 hours of the time Ball applied for the

search warrant. It clearly depicts Abdie in his bedroom in the Apartment in possession of a

firearm. Abdie had no legal authority to possess a firearm. The search warrant affidavit thus

established probable cause to believe that Abdie was unlawfully in possession of a firearm, and




18

                                                A54
that the firearm and other relevant evidence sought by the warrant could be found in the

Apartment.

        C. Photographs of the Search

        The plain view argument as framed by Abdie - that if the police photograph anything

they expect to see in a search location, they have conducted a search for which they need a

warrant - assumes that such photographs require a warrant. The Supreme Judicial Court has not

decided whether the videotaping and photographing of a proper search without court

authorization is unconstitutional. Balicki. 436 Mass. at 13 n. 13 ("We need not decide in this

case whether the videotaping and photographing of a proper search would be unconstitutional).

There are no facts here that suggest that photography of the scene during the search was

inappropriate or that it examined areas in excess of those within the scope of the warrant; indeed,

the defendants introduced none of the photographs at the hearing and presented no specific

objection beyond the mere fact that images were taken. There is no basis to suppress the

photographs.

       4. Miranda issue


       Abdie's claim that his statements made at booking should be suppressed as the fhiits of

the prior illegality mentioned above is meritless.

       Abdie's Miranda claim is also meritless. Miranda has no application to volunteered

statements made by a defendant in custody which are not the product of interrogation or its

functional equivalent. Statements which are '"blurted out,' ix., made spontaneously, unsolicited

and unprovoked by anything done or said by the police ... are not the product of custodial

interrogation and are admissible even if Miranda warnings have not been given."

Mass. App. Ct. 642, 649 (2001) ("Miranda safeguards were not intended to prevent a defendant

from volunteering incriminating information"). Abdie was advised of his Miranda rights at the

Apartment, before booking, and in the normal course would have been re-advised of those rights

during booking. Under these facts, the Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that Abdie

voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his Miranda rights by speaking. Commonwealth

V. Edwards. 420 Mass. 666, 669-670 (1995). The voluntariness of a Miranda waiver "turns on

the 'totality of the circumstances,' including promises or other inducements, conduct of the

defendant, the defendant's age, education, intelligence and emotional stability, experience with

and in the criminal justice system, physical and mental condition, the initiator of the discussion

of a deal or leniency (whether the defendant or the police), and the details of the interrogation,

including the recitation of Miranda warnings." Commonwealth v. Mandile. 397 Mass. 410, 413

(1986). The test is "essentially the same as that used for determining the voluntariness of

statements under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States

Constitution." Edwards. 420 Mass. at 670. No promises or threats were made to Abdie. He was

an adult, had experience with the criminal justice system, and was physically unimpaired. He

spoke to try to exonerate his brother or to taunt the police, not to curry favor with them. His

statements were voluntary beyond any reasonable doubt. Indeed, Abdie's taunting of the police -

that they failed to find more guns - shows that Abdie was freely speaking his mind, not speaking

as the result of any form of compulsion.




                                             O R D E R


       For the foregoing reasons, defendants' motion to suppress is DENIED.

                      UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION
Fourth Amendment
   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
   effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violat-
   ed, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by
   Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be
   searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

               MASSACHUSETTS DECLARATION OF RIGHTS
Article 14
   Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches,
   and seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his posses-
   sions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cause or
   foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation;
   and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make search in sus-
   pected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize
   their property, be not accompanied with a special designation of the
   persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure: and no warrant ought to
   be issued but in cases, and with the formalities prescribed by the laws.
