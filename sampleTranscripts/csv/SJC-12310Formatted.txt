ARGUMENT   .    .     .    .       .   .   .   .   . 31

I.    The medical examiner’s opinion that Ann died at
      least six hours before she was discovered by first
      responders    was    unreliable    and    therefore
      inadmissible because it was based solely on
      subjective observations by first responders with no
      training in death scene investigation that Ann’s
      skin was “cold” and her body was “stiff” and
      speculation that Ann did not struggle with her
      attacker despite undisputed physical evidence that
      she did   .    .    .     .   .     .    .    . 31

II.   The defendant was entitled to a required finding of
      not guilty where the Commonwealth’s case depended
      on expert opinions about the decedent’s time of
      death that failed to account for uncontroverted
      evidence that the decedent was in a violent
      struggle immediately before her death, when the
      defendant was not present      .    .    .    . 47

III. The admission of the unrebutted opinion testimony
     of the Commonwealth’s “paint expert” that the
     Defendant intentionally poured paint on the
     decedent’s body immediately before first responders
     arrived created a substantial likelihood of
     miscarriage   of   justice.   His   opinions   were
     unreliable because they were based on flawed
     experiments which he was unqualified to design,
     naked assumptions or both      .    .    .    . 51

IV.   The admission of disputed and remote evidence of
      domestic violence and marital strife as motive

                               2
      despite substantial recent reconciliation was
      reversible error   .  .    .   .    .    . 85

V.    The trial judge’s sua sponte decision to instruct
      the jury that they could consider evidence of the
      defendant’s consciousness of guilt was reversible
      error where the defense did not focus on that
      evidence in closing and had no opportunity to
      respond   .    .    .    .   .    .    .    . 91

VI.   The prosecutor’s closing argument, which misstated
      facts and attacked defense counsel, created
      a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of
      justice   .    .    .    .    .    .    .    . 98

VII. Cara was deprived of her constitutional right
     to due process when she was subjected to a third

                   ISSUES PRESENTED

     1.   Whether the medical examiner’s opinion as to
the decedent’s time of death should have been excluded
where it was based solely on subjective observations by
untrained first responders that Ann’s skin was “cold”
and her body was “stiff” and speculation that she did
not struggle with her attacker despite undisputed
evidence that she did.

     2.   Whether the defendant was entitled to a
required finding of not guilty where the Commonwealth’s
case depended on expert opinions about time of death
that ignored uncontroverted evidence that the decedent
was in a violent struggle immediately before her death,
supporting a reasonable inference that she was killed at
a time when the defendant was not present.

     3.   Whether    opinion   testimony    from  the
Commonwealth’s “paint expert” that the Defendant
intentionally poured paint on the decedent’s body
immediately before first responders arrived created a
substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice,
given that his opinions were unreliable because they
were based on flawed experiments which he was
unqualified to design, naked assumptions or both.

     4.   Whether the admission of disputed and remote
evidence of domestic violence and marital strife as
motive    evidence    despite     substantial   recent
reconciliation was reversible error.

     5.   Whether the trial judge’s sua sponte decision
to instruct the jury that they could consider evidence
of the defendant’s consciousness of guilt was reversible
error where the defense did not focus on that evidence
in closing and had no opportunity to respond.

     6.   Whether the prosecutor’s closing argument
created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of
justice where he materially misstated evidence.

     7.   Whether the defendant was deprived of her
constitutional right to due process in a third trial.




                          10
                          INTRODUCTION
     The    Commonwealth’s      murder      case    against    Cara

Rintala,    a   firefighter   who     had    no    prior   criminal

convictions, was built on a terrifying combination of

flawed forensic science and outright junk science. After

three    trials,   the   Commonwealth      convinced   a   jury    to

convict Cara of deliberately premeditated murder for the

death of her wife, AnnMarie,1 based entirely on disputed

circumstantial      evidence:        (1)    an     ambiguous      and
speculative time of death estimate; (2) remote motive

evidence; and (3) hotly disputed consciousness of guilt

evidence, including an unreliable “expert” opinion that

she intentionally poured paint on Ann’s body just before

first responders arrived.

     Shortly after 7:00 p.m., on March 29, 2010, Cara

ran to her neighbor’s home with her young daughter,

Brianna. She asked him to take Brianna and call 911

because Ann was in her basement and needed help.
     First responders, who all knew Cara and Ann, found

Cara sitting on her basement floor, holding Ann’s body

in her lap and sobbing. There was blood and paint around

and on Ann’s body and there were other obvious signs of

struggle. The medical examiner determined that the cause

of death was manual strangulation. Cara’s hands and arms

revealed no sign of struggle.

     1 Because both parties share the same last name,
this memorandum will refer to them by their first names.
Also, for brevity, AnnMarie will be referred to as “Ann”.
                                11
     Later that night, and again the next day, a state

trooper   interrogated   a   fully   cooperative     Cara   for

several   hours,   without   a    lawyer.   Cara   steadfastly

maintained her innocence. She insisted that she had come

home to find Ann dead.

     There were no eyewitnesses to the crime. There was

no physical evidence linking Cara to the killing.

     The Commonwealth’s case depended almost entirely on

an ambiguous time of death estimate. Cara told police

she was home with Ann until roughly 3:00 p.m., when she

left with Brianna to run errands so that Ann could sleep.

Ann had just worked a night shift, returned home after

8:00 a.m., and had to return to work for a second

consecutive night shift at 8:00 p.m. Cara came home at

approximately 7:00 p.m. to find Ann’s dead body at the

foot of the basement stairs. The Commonwealth’s medical

examiner opined that Ann died prior to 3:00 p.m. - when

Cara admitted she was home - based solely on second-hand

reports from untrained first responders that Ann’s body

was “cold” and “stiff”. Defense experts, including the

former chief medical examiner for Washington, D.C.,

strongly disagreed. Noting undisputed physical evidence

that Ann was in a violent struggle with her attacker

immediately before her death, they explained that such

a struggle would have sped the onset of rigor mortis and

therefore, Ann could have died as late as 4:30 p.m.,

after Cara had left the house with their daughter.
                             12
       Faced with this ambiguous evidence, two different

juries could not agree on a verdict.

       Prior to the third trial, the Commonwealth secured

a new expert witness: David Guilianelli, an employee of

a consumer paint company. Despite a lack of any relevant

experience, Guilianelli designed experiments upon which

he based an opinion that paint found pooling around Ann’s

body    was    “deliberately    poured”      just    before    first

responders arrived, when only Cara was home.

       Trial counsel moved prior to trial to exclude both

the    medical   examiner’s     time   of   death     estimate   and

Guilianelli’s opinion on multiple grounds, including

that    they     did    not    satisfy      the     Daubert/Lanigan

requirement      that   the   expert’s   opinion      be   reliable.

However, the trial judge denied both motions without an

evidentiary hearing.

       When she heard Guilianelli testify for the first

time at trial, the trial judge openly questioned her

decision to permit his opinion testimony. But counsel

did not call an expert to challenge the reliability of

Guilianelli’s experiments or his opinions.

       After trial, Dr. Arghavan Louhghalam, a professor

of material sciences, provided an affidavit in support

of a new trial motion demonstrating why Guilianelli’s

opinions were not reliable and therefore should have

been excluded. But because the trial judge had retired,

this fact-intensive motion was assigned to a new judge
                                 13
(Mulqueen,   J.),    who   had   been      a    prosecutor      in    the

Northwestern District Attorney’s Office when Ann was

killed and colleagues in that office began investigating

her death. Without disclosing that potential conflict,

she denied the motion and the request for an evidentiary

hearing. At the very least, Cara was entitled to an

evidentiary hearing on her motion.

     On top of all this, there was powerful evidence

that Ann was killed by her co-worker, Mark Oleksak, who

admitted he was in love with her, had secretly given her

credit cards on which she made thousands of dollars in

charges, said he wanted to see her on the date of her

death, was the last person to text her before her death,

deleted that text, hid all of this from his wife, and

repeatedly lied to the police about his activities on

the date of her death.

                     STATEMENT OF THE CASE
     On October 19, 2011, a Hampshire County grand jury

indicted Cara Rintala for the first degree murder of her

wife Ann on March 29, 2010. G.L. c. 265, § 1. R.A.36

     Cara was tried three times: (1) February 20 to March

7, 2013 (hung jury); (2) January 9 to February 4, 2014

(hung    jury);    (3)   September    14       to   October    7,     2016

(convicted    of    first-degree      murder        on   a   theory    of

deliberate premeditation). Tr.3:16:7.2 The same judge

(Rup, J.) presided over all three trials. Cara appealed.

R.A.354.

      Undersigned    counsel      filed    a    Motion     for    Post-

Conviction Relief and an Evidentiary Hearing on March 1,

2019. R.A.144 The motion was assigned to Judge Mulqueen.

She denied it without an evidentiary hearing. Add.123.

Cara appealed the denial. R.A.355.

                     STATEMENT OF FACTS
      Cara and Ann Rintala were married and had a young

daughter,     Brianna.     They     were       both      experienced

paramedics. Tr.3:2:76. Cara worked for the Ludlow Fire

Department.    Id.   Ann   worked    for       the   AMR    Ambulance

Company. Id. They lived at 18 Barton Street in Granby.

Id. at 75.

      On March 29, 2010, just after 7 p.m., Roy Dupuis,

the   Rintalas’   neighbor,    opened     his    door      to    find   a

distraught Cara, holding Brianna. Tr.3:6:19. Cara asked

him to call 911 and told him: “Ann’s in the basement.”

Id. She handed him Brianna and returned to Ann. Id. Mr.

Dupuis called 911 and the dispatcher sent Granby police

officers Gary Poehler and Mark Smith to the scene for a

“domestic situation.” Tr.3:1:146-147; 2:12-13.3

      A.    First Responders


      3In fact, Dupuis did not tell the 911 dispatcher
this   was   a  “domestic   situation”.   R.A.123.   The
dispatcher’s characterization of the call as such was
pure speculation, immediately introducing cognitive bias
against Cara.
                               15
     Officer Poehler arrived at 7:15 p.m. and was the

first officer on scene. He entered the house and heard

Cara crying out from the basement. Tr.3:1:151-152; 2:17.

He descended the stairs and found Cara seated on the

floor,   holding   her dead wife,   Ann,   in   her   lap and

sobbing. Tr.3:1:154-155. This was the first time Poehler

had ever encountered a homicide victim. Tr.3:1:205. He

knew both Cara and Ann through work. Id. at 144-45. Ann’s

body was covered in pinkish-white paint and there was

“what appeared to be a large pool of pink wet paint” on

the floor. Id. at 156; R.A.110. This area of the basement

was in disarray. Tr.3:1:156; R.A.109.

     Sergeant Smith arrived at 7:20 p.m. Smith found

Cara, Ann and Poehler in the basement. Tr.3:2:16.4 He

briefly left the basement to get medical supplies from

a police cruiser. Id. at 21. He then returned to the

basement. On the floor he noted what “appeared to . . .

be white paint, fresh, still wet.” Id. at 23.

     Smith and Poehler then asked Cara to come upstairs.

She explained that she was stuck underneath Ann’s body.

Tr.3:1:165.5 Poehler and Smith helped Cara roll Ann off

of her lap so she could stand up. Tr.3:1:165-166; 2:25.




     4 Like Poehler, Smith knew both Cara and Ann through
work, Tr.3:2:13, and this was the first time he had ever
encountered a homicide victim. Id. at 42.
     5 Ann weighed 202 pounds. Tr.3:2:185. Cara weighed

only 135 pounds. Tr. 3:8:67.
                            16
     Cara,      Poehler       and       Smith    then    walked          upstairs.

Tr.3:1:168. Smith left the house. Id. at 2:33; 3:116.

Poehler and Cara sat down in the kitchen and talked. Id.

at 1:170; 2:31. Cara told Poehler she believed she left

the house sometime around 3:00 p.m. with her daughter to

do some shopping and let Ann take a nap. Id. at 1:177;

2:88.    Cara    told    Poehler         that    upon       her   return,       she

discovered       Ann    lying           face-down      in     the        basement.

Tr.3:1:192.6 She said that she sat down on the floor and

rolled Ann face-up into her lap. Id.

     Smith       called           for    an     ambulance         to      respond.

Tr.3:2:74. Granby Fire Department Paramedic Gene Os

responded       and    encountered            Smith     in    the        driveway.

Tr.3:2:32,77. Smith asked Os if he knew Ann Rintala.

Tr.3:2:77. Os said he did. Id.7

     Os followed Smith to the basement and viewed Ann’s

body. Tr.3:2:77. There was “paint everywhere”; it was

“wet,     shiny”       and        “off-whiteish”.           Id.     Os     “didn’t

understand the paint at all” and found it “extremely

confusing”. Id.

        At approximately 8:36 p.m., State Trooper Jamie

Magarian    arrived          at    the    scene.      Tr.3:1:186.          He   was

assigned to the Northwestern District Attorney’s Office

     6 There was evidence of lividity in Ann’s body,
indicating that she had been lying face down for some
time prior to being moved onto her back. Tr.3:2:210.
     7 In fact, Os, who had known both Cara and Ann for

more than sixteen years through work, characterized them
as friends. Tr.3:2:75.
                                         17
as a detective. Tr.3:11:130. He immediately took control

of the investigation, serving as the lead investigator.

Id. at 131. He claimed that he examined Ann’s body at

some point after 9:18 p.m. Tr.3:12:51. Like the other

first responders who had examined the body nearly two

hours earlier, he described the paint on the floor as

“wet” and “fresh” even though it had obviously been there

for more than two hours. Tr.3:11:251.

       B.         Testimony of Forensic Pathologists

       Dr. Joann Richmond conducted Ann’s autopsy on April

1,     2010.       She   concluded     that   Ann     died    of    manual

strangulation.8 Tr.3:2:191, 196. She noted that Ann had

also        suffered        multiple    bruises,      abrasions,       and

lacerations to her head and body. Tr.3:2:198-200, 203-

204,       207.    Significant    blood     flow   from     these   wounds

suggested that she was still alive when she sustained

them. Tr.3:2:201-202.

       Dr. Richmond opined that Ann had died “six to eight

to twelve hours” before first responders examined her.

Tr.3:2:214.           The     Commonwealth         called     a     second

pathologist, Dr. Thomas Andrew who concluded that it was

“unlikely” that Ann had died after 1 p.m. “give or take”.

Tr.3:8:139.




       8
       There were no recorded bruises or marks on Cara’s
hands or body other than a mark on Cara’s neck which she
described as a hickey. Tr.3:4:13-14; 5:133.
                                       18
       The defense called two pathologists. They concluded

that Ann could have died as late as 4:30 p.m., or three

hours before first responders reached her. Tr.3:11:46.

       As explained below, all four forensic pathologists

agreed that if a homicide victim is engaged in violent

struggle immediately before death, this can speed the

onset of rigor mortis, and there was ample evidence that

Ann was engaged in such a struggle with her killer.

       C.      The Commonwealth’s Paint “Expert”

       In an effort to bolster its case, the Commonwealth

called David Guilianelli, an employee of the company

that       manufactured       the   paint    that     was     found   in   the

basement.          Although    he   had     no    experience       designing

experiments         for   forensic     applications,          he   concocted

experiments to determine when and how the paint had been

applied       to    the   floor.     Based       on   these    experiments,

Guilianelli opined that the paint around Ann’s body was

applied       to    the   floor     just    before       first     responders

arrived — a time frame when Cara was admittedly present

in the home. Tr.3:7:162; 12:152. Guilianelli also opined

that the paint had been “intentionally poured”, not

spilled,9 despite clear evidence that several other items

in     the     immediate        area      had     been      knocked    over.

Tr.3:7:178.10         Although defense counsel cross-examined

       9Although it was clear Ann was strangled, there
was no paint on her neck. R.A.112.
     10 As explained below in Argument III, the defense

moved to exclude Giulianelli’s opinions prior to trial
                                       19
Giulianelli    and   attacked       the    reliability        of    his

opinions,     he   did   not   call       an   expert    to        rebut

Giulianelli’s opinions.

     D.     Ann’s Activities

     Ann worked an overnight shift (8:00 p.m. to 8:00

a.m.) at AMR the night before her death and was scheduled

to work another on the night of her death. Tr.3:9:34.

Police recovered her cellphone from her bed. Tr.3:9:34;

R.A.109.    Her cellphone activity indicated that she was

awake and using her phone between the time she returned

from her shift shortly after 8:00 a.m. and at least 12:21

p.m. Tr.3:4:195; R.A.113.

     Ann communicated with several people including her

parents, her friend and co-worker Mark Oleksak, and

Cara. Tr.3:4:185-195; R.A.113. She made her last call at

12:21 p.m. to her aunt, Nancy Kaufman. Id. at 195.

Oleksak texted Ann at 1:53 p.m. That text was unread.

Id. at 196. Cara texted and called Ann repeatedly between

4:48 p.m. and 6:58 p.m. Id. at 196-200.

     E.     Cara’s Cooperation

     From the very beginning of the investigation, Cara

cooperated. She immediately gave police permission to

search her home and cellphone and take her clothing,

Tr.3:1:189, and to interview her daughter Brianna alone.


on the grounds that they did not satisfy the
Daubert/Lanigan standard for admissibility. R.A.62-78.
The Court denied the motion. Add.116
                               20
Tr.3:3:119; 5:133. Then, she agreed to accompany State

Trooper Robin Whitney to the Granby Police Station for

a recorded interview without counsel. Tr.3:3:121-122.

For two-and-a-half hours, on the night of Ann’s death,

Cara recounted her activities that day. Id. at 129-130;

Exhibit 23.11 Specifically, she stated that she first

took Brianna to look at animals, and then drove to the

Holyoke Mall, a McDonald’s in Holyoke, a Stop & Shop in

Holyoke and a Burger King in Chicopee. Cara agreed to a

second    interview    the    following    day,    again   without

counsel. Tr.3:4:17-18.

     Police recovered security video footage confirming

Cara’s account of her activities. Specifically, video

footage from the Holyoke Mall depicted Cara and Brianna

walking   into   the   mall    around     5:05    p.m.   Tr.3:4:92.

Receipts from stores inside the mall established that

Cara made purchases at 5:19 and 5:29 p.m. Tr.3:4:95.

     Likewise, video footage depicted Cara disposing of

items in a trash can in a McDonalds parking lot at 5:47

p.m. Tr.3:4:96. Police collected the bag from that trash

can. Tr.3:4:103-104, 106. In the bag, they found rags

and a diaper. Id. at 107.

     Video footage from a Stop & Shop on Lincoln Street

in Holyoke and a receipt confirmed Cara’s report that

she bought some groceries there at 6:14 p.m. Id. at 114.

     11The parties did not provide a transcript of this
recorded interview to the jury.
                                21
Finally,   a   receipt    from        a     Burger    King       in    Chicopee

confirmed her report that she bought food there on her

way home. Id. at 115.

     F.     Crime Scene Analysis

     The frame of the side door was damaged. Tr.3:5:155-

156. The tip of a shovel leaning against a wall near the

garage contained white residue, similar to the paint on

the door frame, id. at 151, supporting an inference that

the shovel had been used to damage the door frame.

     Crime scene analysts found several blood stains in

the basement near Ann’s body. Tr.3:5:173. There was one

spatter    stain   on    the        floor    near    Ann’s          body   which

contained a mixture of DNA from Ann and someone else.

Id. at 55-56. Likewise, a stain on a vacuum near Ann’s

body contained Ann’s DNA profile. Tr.3:7:60. Along with

other evidence described infra, this evidence supported

an inference of a struggle.

     Crime scene technicians obtained a partial DNA

profile from a red-brown stain on the gray rag recovered

from the trash can at the McDonalds. Tr.3:7:69. The DNA

was degraded. Tr.3:7:71. Analysts were only able to

obtain     identification            markers        for        two     alleles.

Tr.3:7:70.     Ann’s    DNA    was     consistent         with        these   two

markers.   Tr.3:7:69.         The    probability          of    a     match   was

approximately one in 128 African Americans, one in 118

Asians, one in 105 Caucasians, and one in 106 Hispanics.

Tr.3:7:70. A defense expert, Dr. Frederick Bieber, one
                                     22
of the leading experts in the world on degraded DNA,

opined that this degraded DNA had not been “freshly

deposited” and was not consistent with DNA that had been

exposed to water for a few hours. Id. at 141-42. Rather,

it was consistent with DNA that had deteriorated over a

longer period of time. Id. The Commonwealth’s DNA expert

agreed. Id. at 92, 105.

     G.     Evidence of Marital Discord

     In an attempt to establish motive, the Commonwealth

introduced evidence of the Rintalas’ marital discord.

They clearly had troubles in the past, which had resolved

by November 2009, when Ann and Cara reconciled and Ann

moved back in with Cara. They began attending church

together with Brianna shortly before that and continued

to do so until Ann’s death. Tr.3:9:216-17. There was no

evidence of significant discord after that point.12

     The    Commonwealth   suggested    that   one    source   of

marital discord was Ann’s financial irresponsibility.

Cara and Ann kept their assets separate. Tr.3:11:173.

They were required by law to file separate tax returns.

Id. at 175. Cara owned the marital home at 18 Granby

Street. Exhibit 62. The mortgage was in her name and she

paid it herself. Id. She had other significant assets,

including     retirement    accounts,      and       no   debts.

Tr.3:11:182; R.A.128. Ann, by contrast, had no savings

     12 This evidence will be discussed in more detail
in Argument V, infra.
                             23
and substantial credit card debt. Tr.3:11:172. She had

accounts in default. Id. at 174-175. At one point, Ann

obtained a line of credit exceeding $20,000 in Cara’s

name without Cara’s knowledge. Tr.3:11:177-178. When

Cara found out, Ann began repaying Cara monthly. Id.

     H.     Other Suspects

     Ann took advantage of others as well. AMR co-worker

Mark Oleksak gave her credit cards; she accumulated

about $7,000 in debt on those cards. Id. Shortly before

Ann and Cara reconciled, Ann convinced a former romantic

partner, Springfield police officer Carla Daniele, to

furnish a new apartment for her and take her on a

vacation at a cost of $10,000. Tr.3:11:190, 212, 249.

     From   the    very     beginning   of   the   investigation,

though suspicion had focused on Cara almost immediately,

the police also considered these two as suspects.

            1.    Mark Oleksak

     Oleksak and Ann had a very close relationship that

Oleksak was hiding from his wife. Tr.3:11:188. On the

date of Ann’s death, Oleksak told her that he loved her.

R.A.113 (8:14 a.m. text). He claimed that she said she

loved him as well. Tr.3:11:189. Moreover, he was the

last person to contact her before her death. R.A.113

(1:53 p.m. text).

     Oleksak      opposed    Ann    marrying   Cara   and   their

adoption of Brianna. Tr.3:11:190. Also, he told police,


                                   24
“I would be willing to do anything for a friend as long

as they didn’t lie to me.” Id. at 199.

     As noted above, Oleksak had obtained three credit

cards for Ann even though he knew she had a spending

problem. Tr.3:12:41. Oleksak hid this from his wife.

Tr.3:11:188.

     Shortly before Ann’s death, Oleksak and Ann had

spent the day together shopping. Id. at 191-192. On that

date, Oleksak loaned Ann $350 to buy a dog. Id. The day

before her death, Ann asked Oleksak for $20 so that she

could buy a dog crate. Id. at 193. Ann never purchased

the dog or the crate. Id. at 193-94.

     The morning of her death, Ann was texting with

Oleksak. Tr.3:11:180. Oleksak told Ann that he wanted to

come to her house four days later, on Friday night

because he knew Cara had to work that night. Tr.3:11:180.

But then he texted Ann at 1:53 p.m. and shared that his

sister had just called, told him she had cancer, and he

was “real sad”. Id. at 185. Oleksak deleted this text

message from his cell phone before the police questioned

him. Tr.3:11:185.13

     Police interviewed Oleksak a few days after Ann’s

murder, on April 2, 2010. He initially told them that on

the date of Ann’s death he had been home all day except

     13Police learned of this text because they saw it
on Ann’s cell phone. Tr.3:11:184-85. Oleksak never
mentioned it in multiple police interviews and police
never asked Oleksak about it. Id. at 185-86.
                           25
when he went to physical therapy at 10 a.m. Tr.3:11:194,

235. This was a lie.

      On November 18, 2010, Trooper Magarian learned

something that forced him to re-evaluate Oleksak as a

suspect: months after Ann’s death, Oleksak had been

sleeping in her pink sleeping bag at work. Tr.3:11:197.14

Based      on   this    revelation,       Magarian       re-interviewed

Oleksak about his activities on the date of Ann’s death.

This time, Oleksak said his daughter came over for dinner

and   then      they   went   to    a   furniture    store     together.

Tr.3:11:199.       Police     did   not   speak     to   his   wife   and

daughter to confirm this new information until June 2011

- fifteen months after Ann’s death. Id. at 209. When

they finally did so, Oleksak’s wife corroborated his

claim. Id. at 209. But she stated that their daughter

usually came over on Wednesdays. Tr.3:11:210. In fact,

Ann died on a Monday. Id. Oleksak’s wife did not mention

anything about learning that his sister had cancer. Id.

at 209.

      In July 2011, Magarian asked Oleksak to turn over

his bank statements and phone records for the period

around the murder. Tr.3:11:245. The records revealed

that Oleksak had failed to disclose to police that on

the date of Ann’s death he went to several grocery


      14Because AMR paramedics worked overnight shifts,
they sometimes kept sleeping bags at work, presumably to
sleep in during inactive periods.
                                    26
stores, a Walmart in Westfield, and a gas station. Id.

In May 2012, Magarian recovered a receipt from Walmart

documenting that on March 29, 2010, at 4:28 p.m., Oleksak

bought a pair of fleece pants. Id. at 206.15 In June

2011, neither Oleksak’s wife nor daughter mentioned any

of this. Id. at 209-210.

     Furthermore, Oleksak’s phone records indicated no

activity on his cell phone between 1:53 p.m. and 8:15

p.m. on the day of Ann’s death. Id. at 208; R.A.129.

This was especially odd given that in his last text at

1:53 p.m., Oleksak wrote to Ann, “My sis just called.

She has [cancer]. I’m real sad.” Tr.3:11:208. Moreover,

Oleksak deleted that text from his cell phone.

          2.   Carla Daniele

     Ann and Daniele had dated in the past. Id. at 211.

They began dating again in June 2009 when Ann and Cara

separated. Id. at 211-212. Daniele quickly incurred

$10,000 in debt to set up Ann in a new apartment and a

vacation they took together to Las Vegas. Id. at 212.

     When Ann and Cara reconciled in the Fall of 2009,

Ann suddenly broke up with Daniele and moved back in

with Cara at 18 Granby Street. Daniele told police she

“never saw it coming”. Id. at 216. Ann then asked Oleksak

to clean out her apartment. Tr.3:11:213. But Ann had


     15 Magarian never asked Oleksak why he had bought
these pants or why he had not mentioned it in previous
interviews. Tr.3:11:206.
                           27
never told Oleksak that she had been dating Daniele. Id.

He learned about the relationship while cleaning the

apartment. He discovered a photograph of Ann and Daniele

in Las Vegas and became “very upset”. Id. at 198, 213.

Oleksak stole the photo of Ann and Daniele and a card

Daniele had written to Ann. Id. at 214.

     The day of Ann’s death, Daniele went to her gym in

East Longmeadow at about 3:00 p.m. Id. at 217. Security

video footage establishes that she drove into the gym

parking lot shortly before 3:10 p.m. and left at 7:00

p.m. Id. at 221. Daniele told police that she worked out

at the gym and went for a run in East Longmeadow during

that four-hour window. Id. According to bank records,

however, Daniele made a withdrawal at a Springfield bank

at 6:18 p.m. while her car was parked at the gym. Id. at

218.16 She did not mention this to police.

     Daniele claimed her last contact with Ann had been

in November 2009 when Ann returned to Cara. Id. at 212.

However, Daniele continued to call Ann’s cellphone after

her death. Id. at 222.

                  SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
     The medical examiner’s opinion that Ann died six to

twelve hours before she was discovered by the first

responders was unreliable and therefore inadmissible

     16Google Maps indicates that the gym was 4.7 miles
from the bank, and it takes approximately one hour and
thirty-two minutes to travel by foot one way between
them.
                          28
because it was based solely on subjective observations

by first responders with no training in death scene

investigation that Ann’s skin was “cold” and her body

was “stiff” and naked speculation that Ann did not

struggle with her attacker despite undisputed physical

evidence that she did. [31-47].

     The trial judge erred in denying Cara’s Motion for

a Required Finding of Not Guilty at the close of evidence

because the Commonwealth’s circumstantial case depended

on an unreliable time of death estimate. Undisputed

evidence that Ann was in a violent struggle with her

attacker immediately before her death supported a time

of death when Cara was not home. [47-50].

     The admission of the unrebutted opinion testimony

of the Commonwealth’s “paint expert” that the Defendant

intentionally    poured   paint   on    the   decedent’s   body

immediately before first responders arrived created a

substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The

totality of the evidence, including the post-conviction

affidavit   of    a   professor    of     material   science,

demonstrated that his opinions were unreliable because

they were based on flawed experiments which he was

unqualified to design, assumptions or both. [51-84].

     The admission of disputed and remote evidence of

domestic violence and marital strife as motive evidence

despite substantial recent reconciliation was reversible

error. [85-90].
                             29
      The trial judge’s sua sponte decision to instruct

the jury that they could consider evidence of Cara’s

consciousness of guilt was reversible error where the

defense   did   not   focus    on    the   evidence   in   closing

argument. [91-98].

      During closing argument, the prosecutor misstated

the   facts   and   attacked   defense     counsel,   creating   a

substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice. [98-

103].

      Cara was deprived of her constitutional right to

due process when she was subjected to a third trial.

[103-105].

                             ARGUMENT

I.   The medical examiner’s opinion that Ann died at
     least six hours before she was discovered by first
     responders    was    unreliable    and    therefore
     inadmissible because it was based solely on
     subjective observations by first responders with no
     training in death scene investigation that Ann’s
     skin was “cold” and her body was “stiff” and
     speculation that Ann did not struggle with her
     attacker despite undisputed physical evidence that
     she did.
     Prior to the second trial, defense counsel filed a

motion in limine to bar expert testimony by the medical

examiner, Dr. Joann Richmond, as to time of death and

requested a Lanigan hearing. R.A.48. In support of the

motion, he included a written opinion from Dr. Jonathan

Arden,    the   former     chief    medical   examiner     for   the

District of Columbia. The trial judge denied the motion

without    a    hearing.    Add.115.     Counsel    renewed      his

objection during the third trial. Tr.3:3:101.

     Because Dr. Richmond’s opinion on time of death was

not based on sufficient “facts or data” and was not “a

product of reliable principles and methods” reliably

applied to the case, Mass. G. Evid. § 702, it was

unreliable      and   inadmissible.     Because     it     was   the

centerpiece      of   the     Commonwealth’s       case,     Cara’s

conviction must be reversed.

     A.    Evidence Relevant to Dr. Richmond’s Time of
           Death Opinion
     Officer Poehler was the first responder to touch

Ann – at some point after 7:20 p.m. He claimed that he

                                   31
merely placed a gloved finger on her carotid artery to

check for a pulse. He later described the skin on her

neck as cold and stiff. Tr.3:1:162.17

     Shortly     thereafter,        Poehler       and     Smith     worked

together to shift and roll Ann’s body so Cara could get

up. Tr.3:1:165-166; 2:26-27. Poehler grabbed Ann’s right

arm and lifted. Tr.3:1:166. Simultaneously, Smith and

Cara rolled Ann onto her left side by pushing her thigh

and hip. Tr.3:2:26. The officers perceived Ann’s body to

be “very stiff” and claimed “the entire body stayed

together stiff as [Poehler] attempted to move her body

by   moving    her    arm”    while       Smith    pushed     her    hip.

Tr.3:1:166. Smith testified that “[t]he whole body moved

as one unit . . . without any bend”. Tr.3:2:27.

     Paramedic       Os   arrived    at    the    scene    after     Cara,

Poehler and Smith had left the basement. Tr.3:2:77.

Wearing gloves (Id. at 112), Os grabbed Ann’s right wrist

for “a cursory confirmation” that she was dead. Id. at

108. She was “very, very cold”. Id. at 82. Os “pulled on

her . . . wrist a little” but it did not move. Id. at




     17Poehler’s reliability was undermined because (1)
this was the first time he had seen a homicide victim,
(2) he knew the victim personally as a fellow member of
the first responder community and (3) he had no training
determining the level of rigor mortis.
                                    32
80. He pulled her wrist “away from her head”. Id. at 82.

Her arm was “locked in a rigid position.” Id. at 81.18

     Paramedic Michael Pandora was the last of the first

responders to arrive. Poehler led him to the basement.

He merely looked at Ann and returned upstairs without

touching the body. Tr.3:1:180, 202.

     Trooper Magarian arrived at the scene at 8:36 p.m.

Although he had investigated many homicides, and had

attended autopsies, he had no formal training in how to

assess    rigor   mortis   to    determine   time   of   death.

Tr.3:3:57-61. He did not examine Ann’s body until some

time after 9:18 p.m. Tr.3:12:51. Although not documented

in any report, Magarian claimed that he pulled “a little

bit” at Ann’s right arm. Tr.3:11:251; 12:48. This was

the full extent of his physical examination of the body.

He never touched her head, torso or legs. Tr.3:12:53-

54. He claimed that when he did this, “it was cold to

the touch”. Tr.3:11:251.19 He also claimed that “her

entire body moved as one; the forearm, the humerus and

the upper arm, the shoulder, the torso, the hips all

shifted as kind of one board.” Id. (emphasis added).

This claim is problematic.




     18 This “cursory” examination did not and could not
possibly have revealed anything about the degree of
rigor in any muscle groups beyond Ann’s right arm.
     19  Again, like other first responders, he was
wearing latex gloves. Tr.1:9:10,52.
                                33
     Ann weighed 202 pounds at her autopsy. Tr.3:2:185.

As Poehler and Smith described, Cara could not move Ann’s

body off of her lap. Tr.3:1:165. Working together, the

two officers and Cara had to exert considerable force to

roll Ann onto her side so that Cara could get out from

under her. Tr.3:1:165-166; 2:25. Therefore, it is highly

implausible that Magarian, grabbing an extremity and

pulling “a little bit” by himself, could have moved her

torso and hips at all, much less enough to assess the

level of rigor mortis in those large muscle groups.

     Magarian spoke to the medical examiner Dr. Richmond

by phone at some point after 9:20 p.m. Magarian asked if

it was possible for a body to become “stiff as a board”

and “cold as ice” in three to four hours. Dr. Richmond

said no. She estimated this would take six to eight to

twelve hours. Tr.3:3:17-18. Dr. Richmond had no other

data when she gave Magarian this estimate on the night

of Ann’s death. Id. at 18 (“I don’t remember getting any

other scene data”). Dr. Richmond never went to the scene

to examine the body herself.

     Ultimately, Dr. Richmond testified to the same

opinion she had given Magarian on the night of Ann’s

death:   “based   on   the   cooling       of    the   body    and   the

stiffening. . . .[Ann] had been dead for several hours,

somewhere   between    six   to    eight    to    twelve      [hours].”

Tr.3:2:214.


                                  34
     Dr. Arden challenged Dr. Richmond’s time of death

estimate in the defendant’s motion in limine. R.A.52-

56. First, he noted that while post-mortem cooling of

the body can be relevant to a determination of time of

death, it requires an accurate measurement of internal

body temperature, which did not occur in this case.

R.A.54. Therefore, Dr. Richmond’s reliance on subjective

reports by untrained personnel that Ann’s surface skin

temperature was “cold” was unreasonable.20

     Dr. Arden noted that Dr. Richmond’s reliance on the

degree of rigor mortis was equally flawed because it

derived entirely from subjective reports of “stiffness”

from untrained personnel who had not made an adequate

assessment of the extent of rigor in the body.

     In this case, neither a forensic pathologist
     nor a trained medicolegal death investigator
     was present at the death scene to examine and
     document the condition of the body . . . .
     Therefore, from the outset, any estimates of
     her time of death are suspect, because they
     are based on observations made by persons
     lacking the necessary expertise to appreciate
     and document the critical features accurately.
     . . .

     The evidence available regarding the extent of
     rigor mortis when the body . . . was discovered
     is . . . incomplete and suspect. The various
     observers at the scene provided inconsistent
     characterizations of her rigor mortis. . . .
     Notably, none of the observers at the scene


     20The Commonwealth’s own pathologist, Dr. Andrew,
agreed, stating that the description of Ann’s skin as
cold had “no scientific meaning to [him]”. Tr.3:8:148.
                           35
     specifically manipulated different parts of
     her body to determine the degree of stiffening
     and whether it was consistent in different
     areas (which is not surprising, given their
     lack of appropriate expertise in postmortem
     examinations     and     medicolegal     death
     investigation). At best, one can conclude that
     Ann Marie Rintala had well developed rigor
     mortis when the first responders initially
     encountered her. This finding is consistent
     with a wide range of postmortem intervals,
     ranging from three hours up to approximately
     18 or even as much as 24 hours.
R.A.55 (emphasis added).

     B.   Standard of Review

     A trial judge’s denial of a motion in limine is

reviewed for an abuse of discretion.21     “[T]he trial

judge’s gatekeeper role under Commonwealth v. Lanigan …

includes the obligation to determine whether the testing

at issue was conducted properly (and not just whether

the testing method is theoretically reliable)[.]”22 “The

goal of Lanigan . . . is to keep unreliable (or so-



     21 In L.L. v. Commonwealth, 470 Mass. 169 (2014),
this Court announced that it was retiring the “no
conscientious judge” iteration of the abuse of
discretion standard. In its place the Court announced
the following standard:

     a judge’s discretionary decision constitutes
     an abuse of discretion where we conclude the
     judge made a clear error of judgment in
     weighing the factors relevant to the decision,
     such that the decision falls outside the range
     of reasonable alternatives.

called    ‘junk’)    science   from    fact   finders,   thereby

reducing the prospect of the return of verdicts . . . of

dubious validity.”23 If the process or theory underlying

an expert’s opinion lacks reliability, that opinion is

inadmissible.24

     Although opinion testimony on time of death is

generally   admissible,25      the    Commonwealth   must   still

demonstrate the reliability of an expert opinion subject

to a Lanigan challenge by a preponderance of the evidence

in order to present it to the jury. Commonwealth v.

Camblin, 478 Mass. 469, 476 (2017).26

     C.     Argument

            1.      Time of death estimates based solely on
                    rigor mortis are unreliable and not
                    generally accepted in the field of
                    forensic pathology.

(N.C. Ct. App. 2011) (unpublished) (“Since it is unclear
from his testimony what other factors besides Morton’s
state of rigor mortis, if any, were used by M.E. Paysour
to bring his estimate of Morton’s time of death outside
the initial eight-to-ten-hour window predicted by
Morton's state of rigor mortis, his method of proof for
determining Morton's time of death cannot be said to be
sufficiently reliable to be admissible at trial under
Rule 702. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion by
admitting M.E. Paysour's estimate of Morton's time of
death.”)
                                37
       The only “facts or data” Dr. Richmond relied on

were        first     responder      reports   about       the   surface

temperature of Ann’s skin and the stiffness of her body.

Putting       aside    the    fact   that   the    first    responders’

assessment of the surface temperature of Ann’s skin,

made    while       gloved,    was    inherently    subjective,      the

Commonwealth’s own expert, Dr. Andrew, agreed that it

was irrelevant to determining time of death. Tr.3:8:148

(“[O]nce blood is not circulating anymore, the skin

takes on a very, very cold tactile sense fairly early in

the game. . . .[A]ny description of her skin . . . .as

being cold or ice cold has no scientific meaning to

me”).27 Dr. Arden similarly noted that Dr. Richmond’s

reliance on first responder reports that Ann’s skin was

“cold”, without a measured core body temperature, was

unreasonable. R.A.55.

       This left only the reports of stiffness. The two

leading treatises on forensic pathology make clear that

time of death determinations based on rigor mortis alone


       27
       Although the trial judge did not have the benefit
of Dr. Andrew’s opinion when she considered the defense
motion to exclude Dr. Richmond’s time of death opinion,
this court has “considered scientific studies that arise
following the denial of initial Daubert-Lanigan hearings
where necessary to ensure an accurate decision
concerning the reliability of scientific evidence[,]”
and has also “considered scientific studies that were
not before [the] lower court judge”. Camblin, 478 Mass.
at 479. In short, this Court considers all relevant
evidence to determine the reliability of scientific
evidence presented to the jury.
                                      38
are unreliable.28 In fact, Dr. Richmond agreed with a

statement in Forensic Pathology that while “rigor mortis

usually appears two to four hours after death and fully

develops in six to twelve hours,” these estimates “can

vary greatly.” Tr.3:3:68 (emphasis added). For this

reason    alone,    Dr.   Richmond’s   time   of    death   opinion

should have been excluded.

            2.      Even if evidence of rigor mortis could
                    theoretically be sufficient to estimate
                    time of death, Dr. Richmond’s opinion
                    relied on insufficient and unreliable
                    information.
     The    issue    here   is   not   whether     time   of   death

estimates are generally admissible or whether they can

rely at least in part on evidence of rigor mortis;

rather, the issue is whether Dr. Richmond’s specific

opinion was reliable in light of the scarce, subjective

and unreliable information available to her about the
condition of Ann’s body.29 It was not.


     28  See DiMaio & DiMaio, Forensic Pathology, (2nd ed.
2001) (“all methods now in use to determine time of death
are, to a degree, unreliable and inaccurate”); Spitz &
Fisher, Medical Legal Investigation of Death: Guidelines
for the Application of Pathology to Crime Investigation,
(4th ed. 2005) (hereinafter Medical Legal Investigation
of Death) (“The variability of post-mortem rigor makes
its use as a postmortem plot tenuous, to be considered
only in conjunction with other timing indices”)

      29 Commonwealth v. Patterson, 445 Mass. 626, 645

(2005) overruled on another ground by Commonwealth v.
Britt, 465 Mass. 87 (2013) (cleaned up) (“specific issue
before the court was not the reasonableness in general
of   [the    expert’s   method].  Rather,   it   was   the
                                 39
     This case is analogous to Patterson where this

court   found   that,     while    the   underlying   theory     and

process of fingerprint identification was reliable, the

expert opinion should have been excluded because the

Commonwealth failed to show that the process could be

reliably applied to the facts of the case. Patterson,

445 Mass. at 628. The Commonwealth’s expert applied the

traditional     methodology        for   examining       individual

fingerprints to a cluster of partial prints using what

another expert witness called a “hodgepodge” approach,

not based on any science. Id. at 638.

     In reversing and excluding the expert opinion, this

Court acknowledged that fingerprint evidence has been

used extensively in criminal investigations for over one

hundred years. Patterson, 445 Mass. at 628-29. The Court

concluded the methodology is generally reliable when

used to identify individual fingerprints, but not to

evaluate   a    cluster    of     incomplete   prints.     In   that

context, the methodology was not sufficiently reliable.

     As in Patterson, Dr. Richmond relied to some extent

on a generally accepted methodology to estimate time of

death but did not apply the methodology in a reliable

manner. Most importantly, she did not personally examine

the body for rigor, delegate the task to a properly

reasonableness of using such an approach...to draw a
conclusion regarding the particular matter to which the
expert testimony was directly relevant.”) (quoting Kumho
Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 153-154 (1999)).
                                  40
trained death scene investigator or, at the very least,

instruct      one    of     the   first       responders        to   perform   a

complete assessment of the body. In short, she failed to

apply accepted principles and methods to the case in a

reliable manner in order to obtain sufficient facts or

data to develop a helpful opinion. Mass. G. Evid. § 702.

       In Patterson, this court noted that the trial judge

must conduct an individualized evaluation of the facts

and    methodology        relevant       to       the   reliability     of    the

expert opinion in each case, even when the opinion is

based    on    a     “generally         accepted           methodology”:     “the

determination of the reliability of the testing process

entails a fact-based inquiry, including questions of

credibility.         While        questions           of     credibility      are

traditionally left for the jury . . . in this context,

this inquiry [is] the responsibility of the judge.”

Patterson, 445 Mass. at 647–48 (cleaned up). Here, the

trial judge failed to examine the reliability of Dr.

Richmond’s          application         of        a     generally     accepted

methodology.          That        was        an       abdication      of      her

responsibility to act as a gate-keeper in order to ensure

that the jury received only reliable opinion evidence.

Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion.

       First, Dr. Richmond measured time of death from

7:15    p.m.,        when     Poehler         first         encountered      Ann.

Tr.3:2:214. In fact, Dr. Richmond’s initial information

came from Magarian’s examination at some point after
                                        41
9:18 p.m. He was the only first responder with any

experience assessing dead bodies.

       Second, none of the first responders who touched

Ann were trained, much less certified, to assess bodies

for evidence relevant to time of death. Tr.3:1:207;

2:43,110; 3:61. Beyond that, Granby Officers Poehler and

Smith had never even encountered a homicide victim.

Tr.3:1:205; 2:42. Worse, all the local first responders

knew    and       worked   with    Cara     and   Ann.    Os,      the   most

experienced of that group, candidly admitted that it was

“extremely difficult” to encounter the dead body of a

fellow first responder. Tr.3:2:106.30

       Third, the degree of stiffness the first responders

noted in Ann’s body was based on very cursory contact

with a very limited section of her body for a variety of

purposes. Specifically, Poehler placed a finger on her

carotid artery to check for a pulse. Tr.3:1:162. Then

Poehler and Smith, working together with Cara, rolled

Ann’s body off of Cara by lifting her right arm and

pushing her hip simply to help Cara stand up. Tr.3:1:165-

166; 2:26-27. Os grabbed her right wrist to check for a

pulse       and   pulled   on     it   “a   little”      for   a   “cursory


       30
        Dr. Andrew explained that there is a national
trend in medical examiners’ offices to rely on formally
trained and licensed “death scene investigators” to
assess bodies at crime scenes for signs of rigor mortis,
as in New Hampshire. Tr.3:8:173-75. Dr. McDonough relied
on such investigators in Connecticut and Delaware.
Tr.3:9:30.
                                       42
confirmation” that she was dead. Tr.3:2:108. Finally,

Magarian pulled “a little bit” on Ann’s right arm.

Tr.3:11:251.

     According to the generally accepted methodology for

assessing rigor mortis, this cursory group of disparate

touches was not adequate to determine the degree of rigor

mortis.   Most   importantly,    no   one    even   attempted   to

assess Ann’s lower extremities for stiffness.

     All of the forensic pathologists agreed that rigor

mortis appears sequentially in the            body, developing

first in the smaller muscles, including the jaw, and

then appearing in the arms and shoulders. Tr.3:3:6-7;

8:140-141.   Dr.   Andrew   agreed    that    rigor   mortis    can

appear as quickly as thirty minutes after death in the

jaw and neck. Tr.3:8:170,176. It develops in the larger

muscles of the lower extremities later. Tr.3:3:7; 8:141.

For this reason, medical legal death investigators are

trained to palpate several muscle groups of varying

sizes in order to determine the extent of rigor mortis.

Tr.3:3:56; 8:164; 9:29. Though Poehler and Smith rolled

Ann on her side to help Cara get out from under her and

in doing so pushed on her hip, this was clearly not

intended to be an assessment of rigor mortis in her lower

extremities, nor could it have been since three people

were simultaneously exerting force on different parts of

Ann’s body. A defense expert, Dr. McDonough, observed

that no one properly assessed rigor mortis. Tr.3:9:30;
                                43
86 (“there was no systematic joint-by-joint analysis by

somebody who is trained in death investigation”).

      Dr. Arden noted that “the discrimination of degrees

of   development    of   rigor   mortis    should   be   based   on

abundant   experience.”     R.A.54.   He    observed     that    Dr.

Richmond’s reliance on subjective reports from untrained

first responders that the body was “stiff”, in the

absence of a complete evaluation of the body for rigor,

was “suspect”. R.A.55.

           3.      Dr. Richmond ignored undisputed evidence
                   that Ann engaged in a violent struggle
                   immediately before death that would have
                   sped the onset of rigor mortis and
                   instead speculated that she may not have
                   struggled.
      “[A]n opinion must rest on evidence or data that

provide a permissible basis for an expert to formulate

an opinion.” Commonwealth v. Barbosa, 457 Mass. 773, 790

(2010). An opinion based on speculation is unreliable

and thus inadmissible.

      All four forensic pathologists agreed that manual

strangulation was the cause of death, Tr.3:8:180, 31 and

that there was evidence of a struggle.32 Moreover, they

      31Yet, when Cara spoke with police that evening,
she had no relevant injuries or scratches. Tr.3:4:63-
64; 5:133.
     32 Tr.3:3:71, 75 (Richmond: “I cannot rule out that

she was struggling for her life. . . . Q: Could she have
been locked in a fight for her life while receiving those
blows? A: She could have”); Tr.3:8:143 (Andrew: “And
there was certainly the suggestion based on the scene
images and the disarray of things that were in the
                                 44
all agreed that if Ann had been engaged in a violent

struggle immediately before her death, this would have

sped the onset of rigor mortis. Tr.3:2:68; 8:142; 9:37.

     Beyond   that,   both    Dr.     Richmond        and   Dr.    Andrew

acknowledged abrasions on Ann’s neck. They conceded that

it was reasonably plausible that Ann had caused them

trying to pull off the hands of the person who was

strangling her. Tr.3:3:37; 8:180. Despite this, Dr.

Richmond   also    speculated       that   if    Ann    were      knocked

unconscious by a fall down the stairs and was strangled

at that point, she would not have struggled. Tr.3:2:197.

     Dr.   Arden    noted,    however,       that      there      was   no

evidence that Ann was knocked unconscious by her fall

down the stairs. Specifically, he noted the autopsy

revealed no injury to her skull or brain. Tr.3:11:37.

Conversely,   he   noted     that    there      was   clear    physical

evidence of a struggle in addition to the fact that the

area around Ann’s body was in disarray.

     Specifically, Dr. Arden noted that in addition to

the abrasions on her neck consistent with defensive

injuries inflicted while fighting off strangulation,

there were many large petechial hemorrhages in Ann’s



basement and her body being nearby this upset container
of paint that suggested there may have been some sort of
physical   altercation   and/or    struggle”);   9:40-41
(McDonough:    “[A]lmost   by   definition    a   manual
strangulation would involve a struggle, yes.”); 11:36
(Arden: same).
                                45
eyes.33       Citing     the    leading        treatise     on     forensic

pathology,34 he concluded that all of this supported an

inference that Ann was conscious and struggling fiercely

for her life immediately before she died. Tr.3:11:36.

Both Dr. Andrew and Dr. McDonough agreed that the “larger

petechial          hemorrhages”      in     Ann’s    eyes       were     also

“indicative of a struggle”. Tr.3:8:181; 9:41.35

       Finally,        Dr.   Arden     noted    that      Ann’s    clinical

obesity       provided       greater      insulation      for     any    heat

generated by struggle and therefore would have sped up

onset of rigor. Tr.3:11:38-40.

       Dr.     Arden    concluded      that    all   of    this    evidence

supported a reasonable possibility that rigor could have

developed          relatively   rapidly        and   therefore      it    was

reasonably possible that Ann had been killed within

three hours of the time the first responders saw her at

7:30        p.m.    Tr.3:11:46.      Conversely,       given      all     the

undisputed evidence, it was impossible to conclude to a

reasonable degree of medical certainty that Ann had been

killed before 4:30 p.m.

       Rather than confront this undisputed evidence, Dr.

Richmond speculated that Ann “could have been dazed or


       33
        Dr. Richmond acknowledged this. Tr.3:3:33.
       34Tr.3:3:34, citing DiMaio & DiMaio, Forensic
Pathology (2nd ed. 2001) (conjunctiva hemorrhages will
be larger if the victim struggles and the assailant
responds with increased pressure about the neck).
     35 Dr. Richmond refused to say whether she agreed

or disagreed with this assertion. Tr.3:3:35.
                                       46
even    unconscious     because    of       [her]    injuries      to   the

scalp”. Tr.3:2:197. This naked speculation was not based

on “evidence or data that provide[s] a permissible basis

for”    an   expert   opinion.     Barbosa,         457   Mass.    at   790

(internal       quotations    omitted).             Indeed,       it    was

contradicted by the available evidence. Therefore, it

was unreliable.

       “[T]he      touchstone          of         admissibility          is

reliability[.]” Commonwealth v. Sands, 424 Mass. 184,

185 (1997) (cleaned up). For the reasons stated above,

Dr. Richmond’s time of death opinion was not reliable.

II.    The defendant was entitled to a required finding of
       not guilty where the Commonwealth’s case depended
       on expert opinions about the decedent’s time of
       death that failed to account for uncontroverted
       evidence that the decedent was in a violent
       struggle immediately before her death, when the
       defendant was not present.
       The denial of Cara’s motion for a required finding

of not guilty was error. R.A.79; Tr.3:12:97-98. She had
a constitutional right to acquittal unless the evidence

established     every    element       of   the     offense   beyond      a

reasonable doubt.36 It did not.

       A.    Standard of Review

       “It is not enough for the appellate court to find

that there was some record evidence, however slight, to

support each essential element of the offense; it must

Amend. XIV; Mass. Const. art 12.
                                  47
find that there was enough evidence that could have

satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element

beyond a reasonable doubt.” Commonwealth v. Lopez, 484

Mass. 211, 216 (2020) (cleaned up). “Further, although

the jury are permitted to draw rational inferences from

the evidence, no essential element of the crime may rest

in surmise, conjecture or guesswork.” Id. (cleaned up).

“That is, a conviction may not rest upon the piling of

inference upon inference or conjecture and speculation.”

Id. (cleaned up).

      B.   Argument

      The centerpiece of the Commonwealth’s case was a

contention that Ann died before 3:00 p.m., a period when

Cara said she was home. Without proof of this claim, no

reasonable jury could have convicted Cara of murder.

      The Commonwealth’s second forensic pathologist, Dr.

Andrew, relied exclusively on the first responders’

description of stiffness in Ann’s body to establish his

time of death opinion. Whereas Dr. Richmond speculated

that Ann never struggled at all because she could have

been knocked unconscious before she was strangled, Dr.

Andrew speculated that certain factors could have slowed

the onset of rigor mortis (e.g. that Ann’s body was on

a   “relatively   cool   concrete   floor”,37   that    she   was


      37 In fact, Dr. Andrew        acknowledged       that the
basement    temperature was         relatively         moderate.
Tr.3:8:143.
                              48
wearing relatively little clothing, and had “unusually

large muscle mass”), and thus could have offset the

effect of the struggle and the insulation of heat by

Ann’s body mass. Tr.3:8:141-45 (“just about a wash in my

opinion”). He cited no quantifiable “facts or data” for

this unfounded hypothesis.

       Unlike the Commonwealth’s witnesses, the defense

experts - Dr. Arden and Dr. McDonough - considered all

of    the   relevant   evidence,        including    the     undisputed

evidence      that   Ann     engaged     in    a   violent       struggle

immediately before death. They noted that this would

have   sped    the   onset    of   rigor      mortis,     supporting   a

reasonable possibility that well-developed rigor mortis

could have set in after 3:00 p.m. – as late as 4:30 p.m.

       “Generally, it is for a jury to decide whether to

credit the testimony of a witness.” Lopez, 484 Mass. at

220. This applies to expert opinions as much as the

factual testimony of lay witnesses. Commonwealth v.

Polk, 462 Mass. 23, 32 (2012). However, where “it is

impossible to reconcile [one witness’s] testimony not

only with the testimony of each of the other witnesses,

but also with . . . uncontroverted testimony”, Lopez,

484    Mass.    at     220,    this      principle        must    yield.

Furthermore, “[w]hile it is true that the jury may

believe part of a witness’s testimony and reject part or

believe all or reject all, the jury’s right to selective

credibility     does    not    permit      [them]    to    distort     or
                                   49
mutilate any integral portion of the testimony or permit

them to believe an unfounded hypothesis.” Id. at 217

(cleaned up) (emphasis added).

       “If a rational jury necessarily would have had to

employ      conjecture      in    choosing         among    the    possible

inferences from the evidence presented, the evidence is

insufficient to sustain the Commonwealth’s burden of

proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Commonwealth

v. Rodriguez, 456 Mass. 578, 582 (2010) (cleaned up).38

       The Commonwealth’s theory that Ann died at least

six hours before Poehler and Smith first moved her at

7:30    p.m.   is   based    on    impermissible           conjecture   and

inferential         leaps        that       were     contradicted        by

uncontroverted testimony pointing to a violent struggle

that would have sped up the onset of rigor. Accordingly,

“[b]ecause the Commonwealth’s evidence was insufficient

to   demonstrate      beyond       a    reasonable         doubt   [Cara’s]

presence when [Ann] was [strangled], the conviction

cannot stand.” Lopez, 484 Mass. at 221.



       38
        See Lopez, 484 Mass. at 218 (murder conviction
reversed because Commonwealth’s theory required the jury
to engage in “impermissible conjecture” and make
“impermissible inferential leaps”); Commonwealth v.
Mazza, 399 Mass. 395, 399 (1987) (no rational jury could
convict defendant of murder where case built on
impermissible conjecture); Commonwealth v. Salemme, 395
Mass. 594 599-600 (1985) (“If, upon all the evidence,
the question of the guilt of the defendant is left to
conjecture or surmise and has no solid foundation in
established facts, a verdict of guilty cannot stand.”).
                                       50
III. The admission of the unrebutted opinion testimony
     of the Commonwealth’s “paint expert” that the
     Defendant intentionally poured paint on the
     decedent’s body immediately before first responders
     arrived created a substantial likelihood of a
     miscarriage   of   justice.   His   opinions   were
     unreliable because they were based on flawed
     experiments which he was unqualified to design,
     naked assumptions or both.
     In 2014, after the second trial, the Commonwealth

notified    the   defense     that       it   might    call   David

Guilianelli, an employee of the company that made the
paint in the basement, as an expert witness to opine

about “the manner and pace at which [the paint] dries in

specific atmospheric conditions”, the amount of paint

spilled, and the amount of time that passed between when

the paint was “dumped/poured/spilled” and when it was

first photographed. R.A.157 ¶7.

     In May 2015 the Commonwealth disclosed results from

some of Guilianelli’s experiments. Id. at ¶8.

     On May 2, 2016, defense counsel filed a motion in

limine     challenging      the        admissibility    of    these

experiments as irrelevant. R.A.62.

     During the last week of May 2016, more than three

months before trial, the Commonwealth produced a report

by Guilianelli, in which he opined that the paint around

Ann’s body was intentionally poured on the floor just

before first-responders arrived – a time when Cara was

admittedly present. R.A.211. But he also stated that the

paint may have been applied as much as four hours before


                                  51
the first crime scene photographs were taken at 9:08

p.m., “based on any unknown factors [he] did nor could

not account for.” R.A.205; Tr.3:7:185-86.

     As soon as he read Guilianelli’s report, defense

counsel understood that the Commonwealth intended to use

Guilianelli to prove that Cara deliberately poured the

paint to contaminate the scene. R.A.158 ¶9. Therefore,

he   moved        to     exclude       Guilianelli’s        opinions     as

unreliable. Id. at ¶10. He included an affidavit from

Dr. Otto Gregory, explaining why.39 R.A. 74 ¶2.

     The trial judge heard oral argument on defense

counsel’s motion to exclude Guilianelli’s opinion on

July 8, 2016. Defense counsel did not call an expert at

that hearing because he had not yet located one he felt

he could call. R.A.159 ¶12.

     Nevertheless,            immediately       after     the    argument,

defense counsel attempted to find an expert to testify

in support of the motion. R.A.159 ¶13. Three days after

oral argument, he filed a motion for funds to retain a

defense        expert    (granted).     R.A.222.      Although     counsel

spoke     to    one     expert,   he    found    no   one   appropriate.

R.A.159 ¶13. He ended his search after one week.

     On        July     18,   2016,    defense    counsel       waived   an

evidentiary           hearing     on    his      motion     to     exclude

     39 Dr. Gregory is a social acquaintance of Cara’s
step-father and therefore, defense counsel immediately
concluded that he could not call Dr. Gregory to testify.
See R.A.157-158 ¶8; R.A.74 ¶2.
                                       52
Guilianelli’s opinion and asked the Court to decide the

motion on the papers. Add.116 (“The parties have agreed

that the court can decide this motion based on their

pleadings,       the     supporting    materials      and     their    oral

arguments”). On August 23, 2016, the trial judge denied

that    motion      because    she        found   that   Guilianelli’s

experiments had sufficiently replicated the conditions

in the basement to be reliable. Id.

       At     trial,     Guilianelli       offered    the    anticipated

opinions. Tr.3:7:162. At one point, the judge openly

questioned her decision to permit his testimony,40 and

expressed regret that she had not been able to hear it

prior to trial. Id. at 213. But when the ADA vociferously

objected to her suggestion that she might strike it, she

took no action. Id. at 214.

       After     trial,     undersigned       counsel       retained    Dr.

Arghavan Louhghalam, a professor of civil engineering,

whose       areas   of     research        includes   the     effect     of

environmental          conditions     on    construction       materials.

R.A.163 ¶1. Dr. Louhghalam concluded that Guilianelli’s

experiments were fundamentally flawed and his conclusion

that the paint was applied to the floor shortly before

first       responders    arrived     was     manifestly     unreliable.

       40
        “I’m having great difficulty understanding how
this witness can or should be testifying about this paint
spilled versus paint poured . . . it just seems as though
the hole keeps getting dug deeper and deeper and deeper.
And my inclination is to strike at least that portion.”
Tr.3:7:209.
                                     53
R.A.167 ¶10. She noted that his opinion that the paint

was   deliberately    poured        was   a   naked   assertion

unsupported by any data or argument. Id.

      Relying on Dr. Louhghalam’s opinion, undersigned

counsel filed a new trial motion alleging ineffective

assistance, and requesting an evidentiary hearing.

      Judge Mulqueen’s denial of Cara’s new trial motion

was reversible error. Add.123. At the very least, Judge

Mulqueen erred in denying an evidentiary hearing.

      Alternatively, in light of all the evidence, the

record now establishes that Guilianelli’s unrebutted

opinions should not have been admitted and created a

substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice under

G.L. c. 278, § 33E.

      A.   Standard of Review

      Because this is first degree murder case, this

Court is required to conduct an independent review under

G.L. c. 278, §33E. The question is “whether there was an

error in the course of the trial (by defense counsel,

the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether

that error was likely to have influenced the jury’s

conclusion.” Commonwealth v. Wright, 411 Mass. 678, 682

(1992) (emphasis added).




                               54
      B.   Defense counsel was ineffective for failing to
           request an evidentiary hearing on his motion
           to exclude Guilianelli’s opinion testimony and
           locate an expert witness who could challenge
           the reliability of Guilianelli’s opinions.
      It was counsel’s duty to “[conduct] a complete

investigation    of   the   possible   defense”       and   explore

expert assistance. Commonwealth v. Epps, 474 Mass. 743,

757 (2016). While defense counsel did ask the court to

exclude    Guilianelli’s    testimony    under    the       Lanigan

standard, and did spend a week searching for an expert

to   challenge   Guilianelli’s      opinions,    he    ultimately

failed and waived an evidentiary hearing. As explained

below, because counsel could have found an expert who

would have demonstrated that Guilianelli’s opinions were

unreliable and therefore inadmissible under Lanigan,

counsel’s performance was unreasonable. See Strickland

v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 684-86 (1984).41

      First, given that Guilianelli’s proposed opinion

testimony did not fall into a commonly-accepted area of




      41
       Defense counsel asserted that the Commonwealth’s
late notice of Guilianelli’s testimony contributed to
his inability to locate and hire his own expert –
particularly because he was forced to conduct his search
over the Summer, when many academic scientists are
unavailable. R.A.158 ¶10. Accepting the possibility that
the Commonwealth was partially to blame for defense
counsel’s inability to locate an appropriate expert,
Cara is still entitled to relief “if it appears that
justice may not have been done”, regardless of the cause.
Commonwealth v. Brescia, 471 Mass. 381, 388 (2015).
                               55
“expertise,”        an      evidentiary        Lanigan        hearing    was

especially critical.42

       Second, the trial judge herself eventually seemed

to appreciate that there were serious questions about

the    reliability        of    at   least    some     of    Guilianelli’s

opinions.     In    the     midst    of    defense     counsel’s     cross-

examination of Guilianelli at trial, the judge, sua

sponte, called both parties up to sidebar to express her

“inclination       to     strike”     a    portion     of    Guilianelli’s

opinions. Tr.3:7:209. In response to the prosecutor’s

observation        that    there     had     already    been    a   Lanigan

challenge to the reliability of Guilianelli’s opinions,

the judge noted that her ability to judge the opinions

on    paper   alone       was   “obviously      quite       different   than

having the individual come before the Court and testify

and be subject to cross-examination.” Tr.3:7:213. But in

the face of the prosecutor’s vociferous objection,43 the

judge did not strike any of his testimony. Tr.3:7:214.

She did not offer any explanation for this decision.

       This sidebar exchange in the midst of a murder trial

illustrated with startling clarity the importance of the


       42
        See Commonwealth v. Camblin, 471 Mass. 639, 645
(2015) (trial court erred in refusing to conduct Lanigan
hearing where breath test methodology was new, even
though legislature deemed it generally admissible).
     43 The prosecutor protested against the late-hour

of the Court’s concerns, noting that “if Your Honor had
ruled or indicated that you were unlikely to let this
in, we wouldn’t have proffered that testimony.” Id.
                                      56
judge’s role as a pre-trial gate-keeper charged with an

obligation to evaluate novel opinion testimony to ensure

that it bears sufficient indicia of reliability. See

Commonwealth    v.    DiCicco,    470       Mass.   720,   729    (2015)

(cleaned up).

      Had   counsel    located     and       retained      a   properly

qualified expert, like Dr. Louhghalam, to thoroughly

review   Guilianelli’s     work       and    then   insisted      on   an

evidentiary     Lanigan   hearing       in     which    both     parties

examined Guilianelli and the defense expert critiqued

his work, counsel could have properly educated the Court

on the unreliability of Guilianelli’s opinions. See Case

of   Canavan,   432    Mass.   304,     312     (2000)     (describing

Lanigan determination as “inherently fact-intensive”).

      Lanigan requires the Commonwealth to demonstrate

that its proposed expert satisfies five foundational

requirements:

      (1) that the expert testimony will assist the
      trier of fact; (2) that the witness is

Barbosa, 457 Mass. at 783, Dr. Louhghalam’s affidavit

makes clear that Guilianelli failed every prong.

     When    determining       the      admissibility      of       expert

opinion testimony based on experiments, an essential

consideration is “whether the experiment was conducted

under   conditions        substantially         similar”        to     the

conditions at the crime scene, “so that the jury can

infer something material” from the experiment. Read v.

Mt. Tom Ski Area, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 904 (1994)

(cleaned     up).     Dr.     Louhghalam        demonstrated          that

Guilianelli’s experiments failed this test too.

     Guilianelli was asked to perform two tasks: (1) to

pinpoint when the paint was applied and (2) to determine

whether the paint was deliberately poured. He generated

opinions on both points. However, both opinions were

based on unreliable data or no data at all.

            1.      Guilianelli was not qualified                in    the
                    relevant area of inquiry.
     Because the trial judge did not hold an evidentiary

hearing,     there    was     no     pre-trial     exploration          of

Guilianelli’s qualifications to develop the experiments

upon which he ultimately based his opinions. But at

trial, both attorneys developed this point.

     Guilianelli apparently knew how to build and test

particular       paint      blends      for    ordinary         consumer

applications      (i.e.     brushed     or    rolled   onto     a     flat

surface). Tr.3:7:129, 132, 134-135 (“So we do all of our

                                   58
testing, what we call three mils. . . That’s where we do

all   of   our    testing.   That’s     all   of   our    results”).44

However,    the    subject   of   his    testimony       was   not   the

behavior of house paint under ordinary circumstances. He

was actually asked to design and execute an original

scientific experiment to determine when pools of paint

in varying thicknesses far greater than the intended

application had been applied to a concrete basement

floor. This was completely new to him:

      A:   Now, granted these aren’t -- this isn’t
      an application that we’re typically used to
      seeing so this is a new realm for myself[.]

      . . .

      Q: When you say “a new realm,” am I correct
      that pouring paint out and just letting it sit
      isn’t how it’s designed to be used?

      A: Correct.

      Q: Had you done any testing or studies to
      simulate that situation before?

      A: No, we would never let it dry. You pour it
      into paint pans and things like that. But
      besides spilling it by accident, you typically
      don’t   pour   out   paint   and   check   dry
      capabilities of it.

Tr.3:7:143-144.




      44Although Guilianelli’s job title was “quality
engineer”, he did not have an engineering degree – or
any advanced degree. Rather, he received a B.S. in
chemistry from Baldwin-Wallace University in 1996.
Tr.3:7:126.
                                  59
     Q: And by the way, while we’re on this subject
     of being an expert in wrinkling and dulling of
     paint, you said that you had never done this
     before, correct?

     A: Correct.

     . . .

     Q: You had never, prior to being approached by
     Mr. Gagne, done any research on this topic,
     correct?

     A: That is correct.

     Q: You’ve never read any articles, scholarly
     articles in journals, industry journals about
     judging time of drying based on wrinkling and
     cracking, have you?

     A: No.
Tr.3:7:187.   Guilianelli’s      self-professed     lack   of

qualifications for designing experiments to establish

drying time in atypical circumstances alone should have

disqualified him from offering expert opinions based on

his own experiments.45

     Professor Louhghlam, by contrast, has a PhD in

Engineering   Mechanics   and    specializes   in   designing

experiments, following the scientific method, to study

environmental effects on construction materials. R.A.163

¶1. She publishes her results in peer reviewed journals

to check the reliability of her work. R.A.163-164 ¶2.

           2.   The process underlying Guilianelli’s
                opinions, including the design of his
                experiments,   was  not   reliable   and
                therefore his opinions were not based on
                “sufficient facts or data”.
     Dr. Louhghalam demonstrated that Guilianelli did

not follow the most basic elements of the scientific

method. First, he did not design or execute reliable

experiments     replicating        “substantially    similar”

conditions to determine the rate at which the paint found

in the circumstances of this case would have dried. Read,

37 Mass. App. Ct. at 904. His experiments did not control

for any important characteristics of the paint or the

basement   environment,   such     as   paint   thickness   and

homogeneity, the fact that the paint was disturbed,

humidity level, temperature, airflow or the porosity of

the substrate. R.A.167-176 ¶¶10-23.46 Furthermore, he did

not pour the paint directly on concrete, but poured it

on a sealed surface. R.A.172 ¶¶18-19. Also, he did not

pour the paint onto a rigid substrate. R.A.173 ¶20.



     46 The judge credited Guilianelli’s control of
temperature and humidity [Add.121] but refused to
confront his failure to control for these other factors.
She asserted that these failings merely affected the
weight of Guilianelli’s opinions. Add.121.
                              61
      Second, he did not repeat the trials at different

paint thicknesses, humidity levels and temperatures,

reporting the average and standard deviation of results.

R.A.169-171     ¶¶12-16.      Rather,    he    conducted    only   six

trials total, introducing different variables in each.

      Third,    Guilianelli’s        methodology     was   inherently

subjective. He merely observed wet paint over time in a

variety of conditions. He then compared photographs of

this paint to crime scene photographs. He then drew

conclusions about how long the paint in the basement had

been drying based on its apparent visual similarity to

the paint in his experiments.

                  a.        Guilianelli’s experiments did not
                            control        for         relevant
                            characteristics of the paint or the
                            environment and he did not repeat
                            them to confirm the results
      Guilianelli’s experiments (1) used the same brand

of   paint    found    in    the    basement   and   (2)   sometimes

replicated the temperature and humidity readings on the

dehumidifier found in the basement. But even as to the

limited      conditions      that    Guilianelli      attempted     to

replicate (temperature and humidity),47 trial counsel



      47Guilianelli conducted the first trial in his
office without attempting to replicate the temperature
and humidity of the Rintala basement. Tr.3:7:145. He
conducted the second trial in a large environmental
chamber in which he was not able to control temperature
and humidity accurately. Id. at 144-46. He conducted the
final four trials in a small environmental chamber in
                                    62
noted that there was no evidence that the basement

dehumidifier, upon which he relied, accurately recorded

the     temperature       and        humidity.       Tr.3:7:183.         And

Guilianelli admitted that he did not know whether the

temperature and humidity on the basement floor where

Ann’s body was found differed from the temperature and

humidity around the dehumidifier. Tr.3:7:228.

      Moreover,     in   order       to    control    temperature        and

humidity in his last four trials, Guilianelli used an

environmental chamber with a fan that “blows the air

through it”. Tr.3:7:145. He conceded that airflow would

affect drying time and that he did not know the airflow

in the basement. Tr.3:7:218. Therefore, even if the

chamber was able to precisely replicate the temperature

and humidity on the basement floor around Ann’s body,

because   the     airflow      in    the    chamber    may       have   been

different        than    the        airflow    in     the        basement,

experimentation was necessary to determine the effect of

the airflow on the drying time of paint.

      The most obvious flaw in Guilianelli’s experiments

was that, despite the fact that the thickness of paint

affects drying time, Tr.3:7:227, and the paint at the

crime    scene    was    distributed        unevenly,       he    did    not

determine the thickness anywhere. For example, he did

not examine the topography of the floor depicted in

which he was able to control temperature and humidity.
Id. at 145.
                                     63
photographs        to   determine      the    extent    to    which    paint

pooled in depressions.48 Moreover, with the exception of

a single trial,49 he did not determine the thickness of

the paint in his experiments. R.A.170 ¶15.

     In a single trial - Trial 5 - Guilianelli purported

to address “how drying time would be affected if paint

pooled    in   a    depression.”        R.A.204.       Specifically,     he

filled a tray, lined with aluminum foil, with 300 grams

of paint and compared its characteristics over time to

a shallower pool of paint. Undermining his effort to

study paint thickness, he added an additional variable,

placing the tray onto a concrete slab, to determine if

that affected drying time. In fact, the tray of paint

never     dried,        even   after     24    hours.        R.A.176   ¶23.

Regardless, because he did not determine the paint’s

     48 At trial, Guilianelli explained that his company
added a pink dye to this paint that was designed to
evaporate within 30 minutes after application, turning
the applied paint from pink to white. Tr.3:7:135. And
yet, crime scene photos made clear that the paint at the
crime scene was still pink in many places long after
first responders arrived, illustrating that the paint
clearly dried much more slowly here than it would have
in its intended commercial application. See e.g.
R.A.125-127. Guilianelli conceded that even in his
experiments, the pink dye did not evaporate and
therefore offered no guidance in the drying time of
thicker applications of paint. Tr.3:7:138.
     49 In “Trial 1”, Guilianelli applied paint at a

thickness of “40 mil” or 40/1000’s of an inch. He
determined that this sample dried in three hours and 40
minutes. But this thickness appeared much thinner than
most areas at the crime scene and in any event,
Guilianelli did not control for temperature or relative
humidity in this experiment. Tr.3:7:145; R.A.170 ¶15.
                                    64
thickness, did not conduct multiple tests at multiple

thicknesses,   and   added   an   additional   variable   –   a

concrete slab - this single test provided virtually no

quantifiable data on the relationship of paint thickness

to drying time.

     Dr. Louhghalam noted that since Guilianelli did not

measure the thickness of the paint in his trials and

never established reliable outer bounds for drying time,

he could not draw any conclusions about the significance

of the fact that paint at the crime scene might have

been wet in places. R.A.170-171,176 ¶¶16,23.

     Second, Guilianelli failed to address the fact that

the paint found at the scene was clearly disturbed.50

Once again, he conducted a single experiment – Trial 5

– which attempted to address this point. In the trial,

a film eventually formed on the paint he had poured into

a tray. After 24 hours, he removed the film, only to

find wet paint underneath. This experiment demonstrated

two important points: (1) in some circumstances, thick

applications of this paint are still wet, 24 hours after

application; and (2) where this paint dries enough to

form a surface film or skin, it can conceal wet paint,

which will be revealed if the paint is disturbed.51

     50 For example, paint had pooled between Ann’s body
and the floor. It appeared that when she was turned onto
her back, this paint was disturbed and some of it dripped
down her side.
     51 Guilianelli acknowledged this point at trial.

Tr.3:7:138 (“when [paint is] thicker, . . .[o]ver time
                             65
     This result rendered meaningless his observation of

drips and sags of paint on Ann’s body. More specifically,

in support of his opinion that the paint was “freshly

applied”, he noted that when Ann was rolled onto her

back, paint dripped down the side of her stomach and

torso. R.A.206; Tr.3:7:165. Dr. Louhghalam explained

that this opinion was unreliable because it was not based

on experimental data:

     The flaw in his reasoning is that he had no
     data about how long the paint under the body
     could remain wet because he did not know how
     much paint was stuck under the body when it
     was turned over and did not properly test for
     variable amounts of paint to try and establish
     a reliable predictive model.
R.A.177 ¶ 24. Indeed, it was clear that paint had pooled

under Ann’s body before she was turned onto her back

(Tr.3:7:217), and the turning of her body disturbed that

pooled paint. Guilianelli’s own observation that thicker

applications of this paint can take more than 24 hours
to dry and that a skin or film can form on thicker

applications of paint, concealing wet paint underneath

(Trial 5), demonstrated that it was possible the paint

dripping on Ann’s body could have been applied to the

floor hours before she was moved.




you’re going to start forming a film so it’s going to be
harder for [the pink dye] to escape [i.e. evaporate] out
of that latex film that’s started on the top. So it’s
not a linear [drying] progression.”).
                           66
     Guilianelli also noted a lack of paint “tearing”52

around the body. Tr.3:7:166. But Dr. Louhghalam noted

that this was explainable by the fact that the paint in

the area around the body was much thicker than paint

that has been applied to a flat surface with a roller.

R.A.178     ¶25.     She   noted    once     again      that      without

appropriate        experimentation      controlling         for    paint

thickness,     Guilianelli         could     not     make      reliable

statements about when tearing would have occurred. Id.

     Third, Guilianelli did not attempt to determine how

long the paint had been in the basement, the conditions

in which it had been stored or to what degree it had

separated.53 As he acknowledged, paint is made up of

three components - solvents, binders and pigments -

which     “separate    over   time.”       R.A.199.54    Crime     scene

photographs establish that the spilled paint had clearly

separated. Accordingly, it would have dried at different

rates in different locations depending on the percentage


     52 When paint is applied smoothly and evenly on a
flat surface over paint tape, and then it dries, it can
tear like paper if the paint tape is removed rapidly.
     53 At trial, Guilianelli implied that he accounted

for this factor by using paint “that had been sitting
there for a while. I would say at least four to six
months.” Tr.3:7:149. In addition to the fact that this
was obviously an imprecise estimate of the age of his
test paint, he offered no information about the
conditions in which the test paint had been stored (e.g.
temperature, humidity, condition of lid).
     54  At trial, Guilianelli seemed to contradict
himself. He claimed this was “a pretty stable paint
system”. Tr.3:7:148.
                                   67
of   the   three    components.     Despite          this,    Guilianelli

proceeded on the oxymoronic premise that the paint was

“homogeneous except for the [pink] dye” when distributed

(R.A.199), implying erroneously, that it would have

dried at a uniform rate.

      Finally, Guilianelli did not attempt to replicate

the fact that the paint was found on a concrete basement

floor and human skin. He admitted that concrete can be

porous unless it is sealed and that he did not know the

porosity of the concrete or whether it was sealed.

Tr.3:7:216.    He    also   admitted          he     did    not    know    the

temperature of the body or how much paint it would

absorb. Id. at 217. Finally, where paint was trapped

between    Ann’s     body    and        the     concrete          floor,    he

acknowledged       “it   would   stay         more    wet    between       two

surfaces that aren’t allowing air”. Id.

      In any event, he conducted all of his experiments

by pouring paint on sealed CU-1 chart paper (and in one

instance the tray). R.A.204.55

      Guilianelli claimed to test the relevance of this

factor in a single trial - Trial 6 - by placing a cement

      55
       Guilianelli justified this failure by asserting
that a sealed substrate “forces virtually all of the
water to leave the coating through the coating air
interface” and therefore “represents the worst case
[i.e. slowest] scenario for the paint to dry. If the
floor at the scene was not sealed well, it would only
cause the paint to dry more rapidly.” R.A.204.
Guilianelli offered no authority for this naked
assertion, much less data derived from experimentation.
                                   68
slab into the chamber and placing the CU-1 chart on top

of the slab. Id. Since the paint never touched the

concrete, it is not clear what effect the presence of

the concrete slab could possibly have had, but it clearly

did not replicate the conditions in the Rintala basement

where paint was applied directly to the floor. And once

again, Guilianelli undermined his effort to study the

effect of this factor by adding a second variable in

this trial: he placed a piece of cardboard between a

paint sample and a fan in the chamber “to help minimize

the air blowing down on the sample”. Tr.3:7:151.

                 b.    The   “results”  of   Guilianelli’s
                       experiments to determine drying
                       time    depended   on    subjective
                       descriptions of paint.
     Guilianelli admitted that the descriptions of the

paint in his experiments and the paint at the scene (e.g.

“wet”, “fresh”, “shiny”) were subjective and affected by

lighting.     Tr.3:7:189-90.        More        importantly,     his
conclusions were contradicted by the evidence.

     Specifically, the first change he noted was the

“dulling of the surface” of the paint. Tr.3:7:156. He

claimed that this occurred within 30 to 45 minutes. Id.

at 157; R.A.210. He asserted that “wet paint appears

shiny”.     R.A.210.   Moreover,     he     noted      that    first

responders    reported   the   paint       at    the   crime   scene




                               69
appeared wet.56           He asserted that this supported his

conclusion that the paint had been applied within half

an hour of the arrival of first responders. R.A.211. See

also Tr.3:7:162.57

       Even     if    one   ignores    the     inherently      subjective

nature of descriptive comments like “wet” and “shiny”,

and his own observation that thicker applications of

this        paint    sometimes    take       much    longer     to      dry,

Guilianelli failed to note that Trooper Magarian also

described the paint he observed on the floor after 9:18

p.m. – nearly two hours later - as “wet” and “fresh”.

Tr.3:11:251. Clearly, then, the description of the paint

as “wet” was not a “reliable principle” that could “help

the trier of fact to understand” when the paint had been

applied to the floor. Mass. G. Evid. § 702 (a), (c).

       Dr. Louhghalam also explained that perceptions of

“shininess”          or   “dullness”       depend   on   the    angle    of

incident light. R.A.184-185 ¶37. It also depends on the

amount of film. The speed with which film forms depends,


       56
        Guilianelli quoted observations of the paint from
Granby police officers Poehler and Smith, and Granby
Fire Department paramedics Os and Pandora. R.A.209.
     57   Guilianelli  claimed   that   his   experiments
established that after paint dulls, the edge dries and
a lip forms within 60 minutes. Then, he claimed that
wrinkling and cracking appear around the edges within 90
minutes. Finally, he claimed that cracking and waviness
appears in the center of the pool. Tr.3:7:158-59.
Presumably, Guilianelli thought all of this was
irrelevant because first responders reported the paint
was still wet when they arrived.
                                      70
in turn, on temperature, humidity and airflow, which was

unknown. R.A.185-186 ¶39.

     Finally, Guilianelli opined that the paint was

recently applied based on cracking that appeared “the

next day”. Tr.3:7:168. However, Dr. Louhghalam noted

that the relationship between the thickness of paint,

drying and the appearance of cracking is not linear.

Therefore,    she    noted   that    experimentation    would    be

necessary to draw reliable conclusions about the time

required to develop cracking at various thicknesses.

R.A.186 ¶40. Because Guilianelli had not performed any

experiments that controlled for thickness, his opinions

about the relevance of cracking were unhelpful. Id.

                    c.   Guilianelli’s  opinion   that  the
                         paint was deliberately poured was
                         not based on any experimental data
                         at all.
     Guilianelli’s        opinion     that    the     paint     was

deliberately poured, rather than accidentally spilled,

was even more problematic. He claimed that the pink dye

stains in the empty bucket proved that the paint was

poured out of the left corner. Tr.3:7:177; R.A.199. Dr.

Louhghalam explained that basic scientific principles

demonstrated that Guilianelli’s observations of the dye

stains did not support his own conclusion. R.A.179-181

¶¶26-27.

     Dr.     Louhghalam      noted   that    the    remainder   of

Guilianelli’s opinions that the paint was deliberately

                                71
poured were unsupported by any data. Compare Peterson v.

Foley, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 354 (2010) (expert’s

opinion inadmissible where unsupported by “a basis in

fact”).

       For example, Guilianelli concluded that if the

paint bucket had been spilt “you’d just have a straight

line” as opposed to what he called a “controlled turn”

in Figure 5 of his report, and there would be signs of

spatter. Tr.3:7:178, 192. He admitted that he had not

tested this theory. Tr.3:7:192. First, Dr. Louhghalam

noted this opinion was unsupported by data. R.A.182-183

¶33. Second, she noted that flowing paint could have

covered any spatter, R.A.181 ¶29, illustrating the need

for actual experimentation.

       Guilianelli also contended that if the bucket had

been dropped in a way that caused the lid to come off,

there    would    have   been     signs    of   paint    on     the    lid.

Tr.3:7:175, 198. Guilianelli referenced a photo of a

dark    metal    lid   from   a   round,    unused      paint    can    for

comparison. Dr. Louhghalam noted that the lid materials

were different and, given that both the lid and the paint

in this case were white, it was not even clear, from

crime scene photographs, how much paint was on the lid.

R.A.181-182 ¶30.

        Finally, Guilianelli opined that the paint was

deliberately poured because the lid was found partially

underneath the paint bucket, rather than in front of the
                                   72
bucket, as he would have expected if it had been spilled.

Tr.3:7:175.   Again,     Dr.        Louhghalam    noted    that

Guilianielli conducted no experiments to support this

opinion. Also, she noted that there was pink paint on

the lid (R.A.126), indicating paint had recently been

spilled onto the lid and therefore either the lid or the

bucket, or both, had been moved. R.A.182 ¶31.

     Guilianelli’s     opinion       that   the    paint    was

intentionally poured was reminiscent of the improper

expert testimony in Commonwealth v. Franceschi:

          Laviolette testified at the Lanigan
     hearing that he examined the mark in the road
     and concluded, based on his training and
     experience, that the mark “look[ed] like a
     shoe scuff.” . . . On direct examination at
     the hearing, he testified only as to how, in
     general, he could determine whether a given
     mark was a shoe scuff: “They’re pretty
     identifiable, roughly the size of a shoe,
     sometimes directional. Again, it’s like a
     bicycle tire, it’s pretty clear -- leaves a
     clear mark. Something I’ve seen many times
     before and it’s easily identifiable.”

          When asked later on cross-examination
     what “scientifically acceptable way” enabled
     him to tell whether the mark was left during
     the incident, he responded, “Again, it comes
     from my training and experience of seeing
     these marks, and that’s a mark that, like I
     said, that’s something I’ve seen before.”
94 Mass. App. Ct. 602, 607-609 (2018). The Appeals Court

concluded that the expert’s opinion was inadmissible:

          We   agree  with  the   defendant  that
     Laviolette did not articulate a methodology
     that is sufficiently reliable to satisfy the

                               73
      Lanigan standard. His testimony that it looked
      to him like a shoe scuff simply states his
      conclusion. While training and experience, to
      which Laviolette referred, might have taught
      him a methodology, it is not itself a
      methodology. . . . In the absence of any
      explanation of how he identifies the mark as
      a shoe scuff, Laviolette’s circular statement
      that he has seen such marks before at accident
      scenes, with its implication that this one
      looked like the others, is not an explanation
      of methodology.
Id.     at   609-610      (emphasis     added).       The    flaw   in

Guilianelli’s opinion was identical. One exchange with

defense counsel illustrates the point:

      A: When you kick it or something, it’s going
      to spatter.

      Q: How do you know that?

      A: Because I’ve dropped this paint before.

      Q:   Have   you  done   it   in  your   test
      circumstances? Have you dropped it ten times
      to see how many times it spatters in which
      direction?

      A: No, I did not.

      Q: That’s what scientists do, don’t they, test
      things in that way?

      A: They test things, yes.
Tr.3:7:192. See also Tr.3:7:197-199; Tr.3:7:205.

      Guilianelli did not articulate a methodology that

was     sufficiently   reliable        to   satisfy    the    Lanigan

standard. His circular statement that he had spilled

paint    before,   that    this   paint     looked    different     and

therefore, had not been spilled, was “not an explanation

                                  74
of methodology.” Franceschi, 94 Mass. App. Ct. at 610.

Had counsel revealed this in a pretrial evidentiary

hearing, there is a reasonable probability that the

trial judge would have excluded Guilianelli’s opinion.

Again, the judge admitted as much in the midst of trial

when she actually heard this cross-examination for the

first time. Tr.3:7:209.

            3.     Guilianelli’s opinions were not helpful
                   to the jury.
     For    the   reasons       explained    above,       at   a   Lanigan

hearing, a qualified expert could have explained that

Guilianelli’s opinions could not “help the trier of fact

to understand” any disputed fact. Mass. G. Evid. § 702.

     In sum, a properly qualified expert would have

demonstrated      that    the    jury    could     not    possibly       have

inferred     “something         material”        from      Guilianelli’s

opinions and so they were inadmissible. Read, 37 Mass.

App. Ct. at 904 (cleaned up).

     C.     Trial counsel was ineffective for failing to
            present an expert witness to the jury
            challenging Guilianelli’s conclusions
     Alternatively, counsel was ineffective for failing

to   call   his     own    expert       at   trial.        This      was     a

quintessential        “battle       of       the         experts.”         The

Commonwealth’s case was entirely circumstantial, and

both sides presented multiple expert witnesses on hotly

contested    issues      (primarily      time      of    death     and     the


                                   75
relevance    of   a   degraded    DNA   sample).   Against    this

backdrop, the absence of a defense expert on the paint

issue must have been glaring to the jury. Compare Epps,

474 Mass. at 768 (“The missing link in the defendant’s

accident defense was any credible expert evidence”).

Especially     where    defense       experts    challenged   the

Commonwealth’s other experts, the lack of an expert to

controvert Guilianelli’s opinions falsely communicated

that there was no expert response.

     D.      The error prejudiced Cara.

     The Commonwealth relied on Guilianelli’s testimony

to add a new facet to its circumstantial case against

Cara that proved inadequate in the first two trials.

Specifically, the prosecutor argued that Guilianelli’s

opinion supported an inference that Cara deliberately

poured the paint shortly before first responders arrived

to contaminate the crime scene. Tr.3:12:152-154. That

two prior trials ended with hung juries “serve[s] as a
meaningful benchmark for determining the likelihood that

the outcome of the third trial was affected by the . .

. mistake.” Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 35-36 (1st

Cir. 2002).

     Consciousness      of   guilt    evidence   was   especially

critical because the Commonwealth had no direct evidence

implicating Cara in the murder. Guilianelli’s opinion




                                 76
that the paint was deliberately poured was the only new

– albeit unreliable – evidence proffered on the point.58

     In prior trials, the prosecutor had merely argued

that the presence and appearance of the paint suggested

an effort to contaminate the crime scene. Tr.1:12:63-

65; 2:13:96. The impact of offering “expert” opinion in

support of an asserted inference is a familiar notion.59

Guilianelli’s   testimony   improperly   vouched   for   the

prosecutor’s desired inferences. “A witness, lay or

expert, may not form conclusions for a jury that they

are competent to reach on their own.”60




     58 The Commonwealth presented two other pieces of
evidence that allegedly illustrated consciousness of
guilt. See e.g., Tr.3:12:149 (Cara’s voicemails to Ann
as veiled attempts to create a false alibi); 12:150
(degraded DNA on a discarded rag as disposal of
evidence). Both had been presented at the first two
trials and had obviously been insufficient, combined
with other evidence, to secure a conviction.
     59 See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982)

(commenting generally on the significant sway expert
testimony may hold over jurors’ opinions); Frangipane,
433 Mass. at 537     (finding prejudice where improper
expert testimony “served to bolster the complainant’s
credibility   by   providing   a  medically   scientific
explanation for his purported memory loss and its later
recovery”); Commonwealth v. Tanner, 45 Mass. App. Ct.
576, 581 (1998) (“When the evidence comes from the mouth
of a police expert witness, and so bears an official
imprimatur, the likelihood for prejudice is great”).
     60 United States v. Freeman, 730 F.3d 590, 597 (6th

Cir. 2013). See also Tanner, 45 Mass. App. Ct. at 581;
Commonwealth v. Connolly, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 580, 593
(2017), citing Freeman, 730 F.3d at 597 (lay opinion
should not “merely tell the jury what result to reach”).
                            77
       The prosecutor spent more than two pages of his

closing   argument        discussing        Guilianelli’s          opinions.

Tr.3:12:152-54. He asserted, “[t]here can be no question

that paint was intentionally poured, deliberately poured

on the body . . . .this was an intentional pour.” Id. at

152. See Id. at 153-55 (seven references to “poured”

paint). Then he asserted “there’s no way that if that

body had been killed at the same time the paint had been

poured, that paint would be fresh and wet and liquidy

when   first    responders      got       there.”    Id.      at     153.   The

prosecutor       explicitly          relied         on        Guilianelli’s

experiments in support of this argument. Id.

       The prosecutor’s focus on his claim that the paint

was intentionally poured was particularly noteworthy

given the judge’s candid acknowledgement in the midst of

Guilianelli’s        cross-examination,         that       she     regretted

admitting      his    opinion        that    the     paint         had      been

intentionally        poured.    If    not     for    the      prosecutor’s

vigorous objection, the judge made clear she would have

stricken at least that much. And yet, the prosecutor had

no   hesitation      to   press      this    claim       in    his    closing

argument. Worse still, the judge bolstered this claim by

instructing the jury sua sponte that there was “evidence

that Cara altered the crime scene” which the jury could




                                     78
consider as consciousness of guilt. Tr.3:12:193.61 See

Argument V, infra.

     If defense counsel had called Dr. Louhghalam to

explain why Guilianelli’s experiments were flawed and

his opinions were nothing more than speculation, the

prosecutor never could have made these claims. But he

did and the jury relied on them.

     Lest there be any doubt about this, on a nationally

televised   news   program,   Dateline   NBC,   the   jurors

themselves explained that Guilianelli’s opinion that the

paint had been intentionally and recently poured was a

major inculpatory factor in their deliberations:

     Interviewer: [Juror C], do you agree there are
     some time problems between when you believe
     the time of death is and this paint still being
     wet?

     Juror C: Oh absolutely.

     Interviewer: What do you make of it?

     Juror C: I really – I almost wanted her to
     admit to spilling the paint just to make sense
     out of it, because without her spilling the
     paint, it just didn’t make any sense.




     61 There was no paint on Ann’s neck or hands. See
R.A.109, 112. Given that Ann was strangled and the
evidence that she struggled to pull her attacker’s hands
from her neck, it seems the killer would have been most
likely to cover these areas with paint if he or she
intended to conceal evidence of guilt.
                              79
R.A.351.62 Clearly then, counsel’s failure to call an

expert    witness   to    demonstrate    the    unreliability    of

Guilianelli’s opinions “was likely to have influenced

the jury’s conclusions.” Wright, 411 Mass. at 682.

     E.     Judge Mulqueen improperly denied Cara’s
            request for an evidentiary hearing on her
            motion for a new trial.
     Judge    Mulqueen     denied      Cara’s   request   for    an

evidentiary hearing in connection with her new trial

motion so she could call Dr. Louhghalam. At the very

least, because Cara has raised a substantial issue, this

Court should remand the case to the trial court for an

evidentiary hearing.

     Judge Mulqueen defended trial counsel’s performance

by   noting   that,      with   help    from    Dr.   Gregory,   he

“skillfully hammered home” Dr. Loughalam’s critiques of

Guilianelli’s opinion on cross-examination. Add.127. But

this is not the issue. Rather, it is whether counsel’s

failure to present expert opinion testimony challenging
the reliability of Guilianelli’s opinions to the judge

     62 Ordinarily, the jury’s deliberative process
cannot be used to impeach a verdict. See Commonwealth v.
Solis, 407 Mass. 398, 403 (1990). But here, counsel
simply reviewed a television interview. Moreover, Cara
does not seek to use this information to impeach the
jury’s verdict. Rather, it is simply evidence of the
materiality of Guilianelli’s testimony. This Court is
not barred from considering unsolicited jury information
for any purpose. Cf. Commonwealth v. Kincaid, 444 Mass.
381, 391-392 (2005) (“[S]ome inappropriate information
may be learned from the postverdict inquiry. . . If so,
that information cannot be ignored”).
                                80
as gatekeeper and, if that failed, to the jury, might

have made a difference.63

     Trial counsel’s cross-examination, no matter how

skillful, was not evidence -- further highlighting the

need for a rebuttal expert. Boice-Perrine Co. v. Kelley,

243 Mass. 327, 330 (1923) (“Disbelief of testimony is

not the equivalent of proof of facts contrary to that

testimony”). Moreover, Guilianelli did not make material

concessions and did not waver in his confidence that his

conclusions were correct. In order to render cross-

examination equivalent to Dr. Louhghalam’s proffered

testimony, Guilianelli would have had to concede before

the jury that (1) he was unqualified to conduct these

tests, (2) his tests were not reliable, and (3) his core

conclusions were incorrect. He did none of these things.

     Judge Mulqueen’s reliance on trial counsel’s work

with Dr. Gregory [Add.126] only highlights that trial

     63 See Commonwealth v. O’Neil, 51 Mass. App. Ct.
170, 183 n.10 (2001) (single serious mistake by defense
counsel at trial may amount to ineffective assistance of
counsel despite over-all good quality of defense);
Commonwealth v. Frisino, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 551, 556
(1986); Commonwealth v. Rossi, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 257,
258–260 (1985) (single issue with trial counsel’s
performance required reversal on ground of “ineffective
assistance,” notwithstanding defense counsel’s display
of “high degree of professional competence”). See also
United States. v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n. 20 (1984)
(“the type of breakdown in the adversarial process that
implicates the Sixth Amendment is not limited to
counsel’s performance as a whole specific errors and
omissions may be the focus of a claim of ineffective
assistance as well”).
                            81
counsel       recognized         the   importance    of    Guilianelli’s

testimony. While he made a tactical decision not to call

Dr. Gregory to testify because of his obvious bias, his

decision not to call any expert – after a mere one-week

search - was manifestly unreasonable.

       In fact, the record illustrates that trial counsel

wanted to call an expert. He explicitly stated that if

he had been able to find an expert who would have given

an opinion like Dr. Louhghalam’s, he would have done so

R.A.161 ¶¶ 17, 19. This claim is entirely consistent

with    his    motion       in   limine     to   exclude   Guilianelli’s

testimony, cross-examination of Guilianelli at trial,

and closing argument.

       At   the      very   least,     an   evidentiary     hearing   was

necessary       to     determine        whether     (1)    Guilianelli’s

opinions were reliable and admissible, or alternatively

(2) that trial testimony of an expert could have made a

difference to the jury.64


       64
        See e.g., Commonwealth v. Velez, 479 Mass. 506,
514-515 (2018) (where it was “not apparent on the face
of the record that counsel was ineffective,” it was error
for the judge to deny the motion without a hearing
because “the motion judge could not determine whether it
was ‘manifestly unreasonable’ for trial counsel to forgo
these defenses when he chose to do so”). See also
Commonwealth    v.   Celester,   473   Mass.   553,   574
(2016)(vacating denial of new trial motion and remanding
for evidentiary hearing); Commonwealth v. Williams, 68
Mass. App. Ct. 287, 290–291 (2007)(remanding for further
fact finding to determine if trial counsel’s performance
was   “manifestly   unreasonable”    where   record   was
insufficient to make such determination).
                                       82
     This court should grant the requested relief or at

least remand the case for an evidentiary hearing.65

     F.   The trial judge’s admission of the “paint
          expert’s”   unreliable   opinion   that   the
          Defendant intentionally poured paint on the
          decedent’s body immediately before first
          responders   arrived,    based   on    flawed
          experiments   or   naked   assumptions,   was
          reversible error.
     As noted above, this Court is especially concerned

about the reliability of expert testimony based on novel

scientific methodology.

     Where new hard science is involved, an
     appellate court will always take a hard look
     at the trial judge’s decision to admit or
     exclude the evidence. And, as the cases
     illustrate, the appellate court will not
     hesitate to substitute its judgment for that
     of the trial judge, if the judge has erred in
     ruling on the evidence by finding it either
     reliable or unreliable.”

     65In the event that this court remands the case for
an evidentiary hearing, the defense requests that the
Court order that it be reassigned to another judge. After
Judge Mulqueen was assigned and denied the new trial
motion, undersigned counsel learned from discovery
provided by the Commonwealth that at the time Ann was
killed, in March 2010, Judge Mulqueen was employed as
the head of the child abuse unit in the Northwestern
District Attorney’s Office (NWDAO). In that capacity,
she held a meeting on April 2, 2010, about the well-
being of the Rintalas’ daughter Brianna. Presumably, she
also worked with the CPAC team assigned to the NWDAO
that led the homicide investigation and her fellow
prosecutors who developed the case against Cara. “In
order to preserve and protect the integrity of the
judiciary and the judicial process, and the necessary
public confidence in both, even the appearance of
partiality must be avoided.” Commonwealth v. Cousin, 484
Mass. 1042, 1046 (2020) (cleaned up).
                           83
Case of Canavan, 432 Mass. 304, 317 (2000) (Greaney, J.,

concurring) (emphasis added).

     And    this       Court     makes      a   broad   inquiry;    it   has

“considered scientific studies that arise following the

denial     of    initial         Daubert-Lanigan         hearings     where

necessary to ensure an accurate decision concerning the

reliability          of     scientific          evidence[,]”      including

scientific studies that were not before the lower court

judge. Camblin, 478 Mass. at 479.

     All of the relevant evidence, including evidence

developed       at    trial      and   Dr.      Louhghalam’s   affidavit,

establishes          that    –     putting      aside   any    claims     of

ineffective assistance – Guilianelli’s opinions were

unreliable and should not have been admitted at trial.

     As explained above, the prosecutor relied heavily

on Guilianelli’s opinions in his closing argument and

the jurors explicitly acknowledged that they relied on

the paint evidence in post-trial interviews. In any

event, given that the first two trials ended in mis-

trials and Guilianelli’s opinions were the only material

new evidence in the third trial, it is impossible to

claim    that    it       likely    did      not   affect   the    outcome.

Accordingly, the conviction must be reversed.




                                       84
IV.    The admission of disputed and remote evidence of
       domestic violence and marital strife as motive
       despite substantial recent reconciliation was
       reversible error.
       From the very beginning, Cara made clear that she

and    Ann   had    struggled     in     their    marriage.     She    was

forthcoming        about    it    during    her     lengthy     recorded

interrogation on the night of the crime, which the
Commonwealth played at trial. Exhibit 23.

       But the Commonwealth was apparently not satisfied

with    that.      Prosecutors     introduced       the      details    of

specific allegations of misconduct that in some cases

took place over two years prior to Ann’s death. This

irrelevant,        remote   and   cumulative       evidence     unfairly

prejudiced Cara and should have been excluded.

       A.    Standard of Review

       The admission of prior bad act evidence is reviewed

for an abuse of discretion.66 Barbosa, 457 Mass. at 794.

       B.    Argument

       The   longstanding         rule     of     law   is    that     the

Commonwealth        “may    not    introduce       evidence     that    a

defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not,

for the purposes of showing h[er] bad character or

propensity to commit the crime charged.” Commonwealth v.

Helfant, 398 Mass. 214, 234 (1986) (cleaned up).


       66
       Trial counsel filed “Defendant’s Motion in Limine
to Exclude Extrinsic “Bad Act” Evidence” (R.A.37) prior
to the first trial and renewed his objections throughout
the third trial. Tr.3:5:57.
                                    85
     Because the evidence presented was remote, in some

instances merely unproven allegations, and in others

cumulative of Cara’s admissions, it was insufficiently

probative of motive, identity, or Cara’s state of mind

and alternatively whatever probative value it had was

outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.67

             1.     2008 Assault and battery allegation

     In 2008, Ann accused Cara of assault. Tr.3:5:46-

49. Later, she obtained a restraining order. Id. at

56,60.

     Cara     was    arraigned    on     September   29,     2008.

Tr.3:5:65. At that time, upon Ann’s request, the court

vacated     the   restraining    order    (Tr.3:5:68)      and   in

November dismissed the assault charges. Id. at 66.

     In addition to the fact that this was merely an

allegation, it was temporally remote. Ann brought it

some eighteen months prior to her death. While some

courts have admitted incidents that were more remote,68

there was an ongoing hostile relationship,69 a condition

that was absent here.

     67 See Commonwealth v. Sapoznik, 28 Mass. App. Ct.
236, 245 (1990) (reversing conviction where prior bad
act was relevant as to defendant’s knowledge but danger
of unfair prejudice outweighed probative value).
     68 See, e.g., Commonwealth v. McGuane, 77 Mass. App.

Ct. 371, 377-78 (2010) (finding no error in admission of
middle school incident “approximately six to eight years
prior to the killing”).
     69 See McGuane at 378 (“[T]here was evidence of

ongoing animosity between the defendants and the
victim”). See also Commonwealth v. Butler, 445 Mass.
                                 86
             2.    Events of May 2009

       On   May   12,   2009,    Cara   filed   for   divorce.   See

R.A.115. That same day, someone placed a 911 call from

the Rintala home and then hung up after someone said,

“just leave, just leave.” Tr.3:5:95.

       Later that month, Ann filed for divorce and sought

full custody of Brianna. Id. at 104. On May 26, 2009,

Ann served Cara with the complaint. Id. at 106. Later in

the day, Cara called 911 and Detective Fenn responded to

their home. Tr.3:5:100-101.

       Ultimately, Ann and Cara sought restraining orders

against each other. Tr.3:5:107. The court issued the

orders. R.A.119, 121.

       In August 2009, Cara and Ann separated and Ann moved

into   an   apartment    in     South   Hadley.   Tr.3:11:127.   On

August 18, 2009, Ann and Cara asked the court to vacate

their restraining orders and the court granted their

requests. Id.

       Ann and Cara reconciled three months later, and Ann

moved back to 18 Barton Street. Tr.3:12:74.

       All of this occurred nearly a year before Ann’s

death. And once again, long before Ann’s death, Cara and

Ann asked the court to vacate their restraining orders,

voluntarily dismissed their divorce complaints, moved


568, 576 (2005) (“The bad act evidence, taken as a whole,
demonstrated continuing animosity on the defendant’s
part toward [the victim]”).
                                  87
back in together, and, by all account, made a serious

mutual effort to reconcile. Tr.3:12:75. Therefore, this

evidence held little probative value but significant

unfair prejudicial effect.

             3.     Alleged quarrel in February 2010

      In February 2010, Cara and Ann visited Ann’s aunt,

Nancy Kaufman, in Florida while on vacation. Tr.3:4:143-

146. She claimed that they quarreled. Id.

      And yet, in the same trip, Cara and Ann visited

Cara’s uncle Jim Roberts. They had just come from a

cruise     with    Brianna     which    they        enjoyed    greatly.

Tr.3:11:123. They also expressed a desire to move to

Florida together. Id.

      Accordingly, the claims of Ann’s aunt, a biased

witness,     carried     little   probative     value,        especially

where Cara immediately disclosed to police that she and

Ann struggled in their marriage. “Any minimal value it

may   have   had    in   adding   to   an   understanding        of   the

relationship       was   far   outweighed      by    its   prejudicial

nature.” Commonwealth v. Almeida, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 607,

612–13 (1997).

             4.     Evidence of more recent reconciliation

      There was ample evidence of genuine more recent

reconciliation. Cara and Ann started attending church

together with Brianna in October 2009, even before Ann

moved back home. Tr.3:9:202. Cara’s father testified

that they had been going to counseling. Tr.3:12:74. When
                                  88
Cara’s       uncle     visited   in   2009,     they    all    had    dinner

together          in   Ann’s   apartment.     Tr.3:11:121.       As       noted

above, in February 2010, they took a vacation cruise and

visited family in Florida. Id. at 123. And in the weeks

and days before Ann’s death, witnesses saw Cara and Ann

together,          apparently     happy,      at    a   race     Cara       ran

(Tr.3:8:226) and taking Brianna to meet the Easter bunny

(Tr.3:9:196).70 This evidence is important because it

illustrates a lack of the hostility, undermining any

basis       for    claiming    “settled      ill-will”    that       in    turn

reduced the probative value of the more remote bad act

evidence. Commonwealth v. Cormier, 427 Mass. 446, 450

(1998) (cleaned up).

                  5.    The trial judge’s ruling

        The trial judge admitted prior bad act evidence to

demonstrate Cara’s state of mind, finding that even the

earliest          incidents    demonstrated        continued   animosity.

Add.109. However, the judge failed to take into account

the remoteness of these events and the fact that they

were followed by a substantial reconciliation in the

five        months      immediately        preceding     Ann’s       death.71

       70
        Contrast Commonwealth v. Nom, 426 Mass. 152, 160
(1997) (no error in admitting two protective orders
where “the claimed ‘improvement’ in the relationship
appears to consist only of the defendant’s promises,
made only days before the killing, to change his
behavior”).
     71 See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Abbott, 130 Mass. 472,

475 (1881) overruled on other grounds by Commonwealth v.
Beldotti, 409 Mass. 553, 561 n.6 (1991) (animosity
                                      89
Additionally, because much of this evidence would come

in through Cara’s statement to police, the specific bad

act evidence was cumulative, and its admission increased

the likelihood that it would be treated as improper

“propensity” evidence.72

     Finally, the prosecutor exacerbated the prejudice

by highlighting this evidence in his closing argument.

Tr.3:12:140 (“And then there were the bad times. . .

.things getting quote out of control as the defendant

herself said in her interview that night, escalating to

the point of restraining orders, assault and battery

allegations,    multiple    911    calls,   divorce   filings,

allegations     of   both    physical       and   verbal   and

psychological abuse.”) (emphasis added).

     Accordingly, the prejudicial effect of this remote

and disputed bad act evidence outweighed its minimal

probative value and the judge abused her discretion in

admitting it.

                              90
V.   The trial judge’s sua sponte decision to instruct
     the jury that they could consider evidence of the
     defendant’s consciousness of guilt was reversible
     error where the defense did not focus on that
     evidence in closing and had no opportunity to
     respond.
     A.   Relevant Facts

     In   the   first   two   trials,   neither   party   had

requested a consciousness of guilt instruction and the

judge had not given one.

     As noted above, video footage from a McDonald’s

depicted Cara disposing of items in a trash can in the

parking lot at 5:47 p.m. on the date of Ann’s murder.

Tr.3:4:96. Police recovered rags and a diaper. Id. at

107. Crime scene technicians recovered a partial DNA

profile from a red-brown stain on the gray rag, which

was degraded. Tr.3:7:69-71.

     Dr. Bieber, one of the world’s leading experts on

degraded DNA, opined that this degraded DNA had not been

“freshly deposited” but rather, had deteriorated over a

longer period of time. Id. at 141-42.

     Also, as discussed in detail above, paint had been

spilled on the basement floor and covered Ann’s body.

David Guilianelli opined it was poured intentionally

within thirty minutes before first responders arrived.

The defense objected to this opinion.

     During his closing argument, the prosecutor argued

that Cara “concealed” Ann’s murder by disposing of the


                              91
rags, one of which was “presumptively positive for blood

.   .   .with     Ann’s    DNA”.    Tr.3:12:150.   The    prosecutor

disputed Dr. Bieber’s opinion that the DNA had not been

recently deposited. Id. Moreover, the prosecutor claimed

that     Cara    “ma[de]    one    final   desperate     attempt   at

covering up, concealing, misleading” by intentionally

pouring paint on the body. Id. at 152.

        Neither party requested a consciousness of guilt

instruction and the judge did not indicate that she would

give one. Despite this, during her final charge, she

gave a consciousness of guilt instruction, sua sponte:

             Now, members of the jury, you have heard
        evidence and arguments suggesting that Cara
        Rintala may have altered the scene there in
        the basement and at her house, that she may
        have attempted to discard evidence or to do
        other things to mislead police officers.
             If the police -- if the Commonwealth, if
        the prosecution has proven that she did, in
        fact, engage in this conduct, you may consider
        whether such actions indicate feelings of
        guilt by her and whether in turn such feelings
        of guilt might tend to show her actual guilt
        on this charge.
Tr.3:12:193. The judge then gave the rest of the model

instruction. Id. at 193-94.

        Defense     counsel        promptly   objected      to     the

consciousness of guilt instruction. Tr.3:12:226-227. The

judge refused to take any curative action. Tr.3:12:227.

        B.      Standard of Review

        When defense counsel objects to a jury instruction,

“appellate courts conduct a two-part test: whether the

                                    92
instructions were legally erroneous, and (if so) whether

that error was prejudicial.”73

      C.      Argument

      The      trial      court’s        consciousness        of        guilt

instruction was erroneous for three reasons: (1) it

violated this Court’s advice that if such an instruction

is not requested, the better practice is not to give it;

(2)     the    instruction        bolstered       the     Commonwealth’s

irrelevant and unreliable evidence on the point; and (3)

giving the instruction without notifying counsel before

closing       argument    deprived       defense        counsel    of    the

opportunity to address the issue. Accordingly, the error

was prejudicial, and reversal is required.

      First, neither party requested the instruction.

Where      neither     party   requests     the    instruction,          “the

better practice is to allow counsel to decide, as a

matter of trial tactics, ‘to discuss evidence suggesting

consciousness of guilt in closing arguments or simply to

leave it for the jury’s reflection unadorned by comment

either by them or the judge.’” Commonwealth v. Evans,

469 Mass. 834, 845 n.14 (2014) (cleaned up).

      The parties may not want such an instruction: a

prosecutor       may     decide    the    consciousness           of    guilt

evidence “was of peripheral value” and the instruction


      73
       Commonwealth v. Kelly, 470 Mass. 682, 688 (2015)
(internal quotations omitted). See also Commonwealth v.
Vick, 454 Mass. 418, 423 n.5 (2009).
                                    93
could distract the jury from stronger evidence; defense

counsel may be concerned about the risk that it could

focus the jury’s attention on ambiguous or disputed

concealment evidence. Commonwealth v. Simmons, 419 Mass.

426, 435 (1995). Here, there was a risk of focusing the

jury’s attention on the weak, speculative evidence that

Cara intentionally altered the crime scene and disposed

of evidence. Even more dangerous, however, was the trial

judge’s placement of her imprimatur on this weak and

unreliable evidence.

     The      overwhelming          weight      of      the       evidence

demonstrated       that     the   rag    Cara   threw      away    had   no

relevance    to     Ann’s    killing.     The   Commonwealth’s           own

expert admitted that the degradation of the DNA on the

rag was consistent with the DNA having been deposited

well before Ann’s death. Tr.3:7:92. Likewise, as the

judge herself noted, there was no reliable basis for

Guilianelli’s       opinion       that   anyone,     much     less    Cara,

intentionally poured the paint that covered Ann’s body.

Despite     this,     the     judge      singled     out      these      two

speculative       aspects    of    the   Commonwealth’s         case     for

special attention when she mentioned them in her sua

sponte instruction and suggested that the jury could

consider them as evidence of consciousness of guilt.

     “It is error to instruct a jury on consciousness of

guilt based on facts without reasonable support in the

record.” Commonwealth v. Tu Trinh, 458 Mass. 776, 782
                                    94
(2011) (cleaned up). In Tu Trinh, the judge instructed

the jury that they had heard evidence that the defendant

knew of his impending arrest. In fact, there was no

evidence he knew that police had been looking for him at

the time he fled. Id. Accordingly, this Court held that

the instruction was erroneous. Id.

      The same is true here; the instruction was based on

an expert opinion that the judge herself viewed as

unreliable and the disposal of trash with no proven link

to   the   offense.74    The   allegations    that   purportedly

supported Cara’s consciousness of guilt, that she may

have “altered the scene there in the basement and at her

house,” and “that she may have attempted to discard

evidence[,]” Tr.3:12:193, were devoid of “reasonable

support in the record.” Tu Trinh, 458 Mass. at 782.

      Giving a consciousness of guilt instruction based

on unsupported allegations “presupposes that there is

evidence of consciousness of guilt, [and] communicates

to   the   jury   the   judge’s   belief   that   there   is   such

evidence. . .” Vick, 454 Mass. at 424. Though the jury

can “decide whether to credit this evidence, and, if so,

how to factor it into their deliberations[,]” id., the




      74See also Commonwealth v. Brown, 414 Mass. 123,
127 (1993) (instruction should not have referred to
evidence of defendant’s flight where “there was no
evidence of flight in any common sense of the term”).
                                  95
existence of consciousness of guilt has already been

endorsed by the judge.75

       In this case, the instruction unfairly augmented

the relevance and importance of Guilianelli’s opinion

that the paint was poured and the McDonald’s trash, even

though,     perversely,     these      were    two    of   the   weakest

aspects of the Commonwealth’s case.

       Finally, the judge’s failure to inform counsel,

before closing argument, that she intended to give the

instruction exacerbated the prejudice. “A trial judge

must    inform    counsel   of   [her]        proposed     instructions

before final argument.” Commonwealth v. Degro, 432 Mass.

319, 332 (2000), citing Mass. R. Crim. P. 24(b). This

permits     the    parties       to     craft        their   arguments

accordingly.76


       75
        See also Commonwealth v. Groce, 25 Mass. App. Ct.
327, 332 (1988) (consciousness of guilt instruction “may
well have conveyed the notion to the jury that [the
judge] believed that it was the defendant who fled and,
thus, that the victim’s identification testimony was
accurate[,]” even though the judge’s framing of the
instruction sought to avoid doing so); United States v.
Mundy, 539 F.3d 154, 159 (2d Cir. 2008) (due in part to
the “great influence over juries” that judges wield,
where a party objects to a consciousness of guilt
instruction regarding flight, the judge should “think
carefully whether the charge serves a useful and proper
purpose or whether it simply gives court imprimatur to
one side’s factual contention”).
     76 Commonwealth v. Thomas, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 183,

186-187 (1985) (the purpose of Rule 24(b) “is to enable
counsel   to   argue   intelligently   to   the   jury”);
Commonwealth v. Green, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 762, 771 (1989),
aff’d, 408 Mass. 48 (1990).
                                  96
     The judge unfairly surprised defense counsel with

her consciousness of guilt instruction, which she had

not given in either of the two prior trials and neither

party had requested. Though defense counsel addressed

the paint testimony and the McDonald’s trash, he only

mentioned consciousness of guilt briefly. Tr.3:12:115.

In contrast, the prosecutor made it the linchpin of his

closing argument. Tr.3:12:146-155. In fact, after Cara

objected to the unexpected instruction, the prosecutor

countered, “But I think given how strongly we emphasized

[consciousness of guilt] in our closing, it was a live

issue.” Tr.3:12:227. This is precisely the problem.

Given that the prosecutor’s closing argument followed

the defense closing argument, defense counsel could not

respond. Thus, the jury received a one-sided view of

this “live issue”, which the judge then validated. As a

result, the jurors may have concluded that Cara was

conceding the point.

     The error here is remarkably similar to the error

in Commonwealth v. Diantonio, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 1122, *2

(2019) (unpublished decision). The defendant did not

focus on flight in closing, but the prosecutor did. Id.

The judge then gave a consciousness of guilt instruction

sua sponte. Id. The Appeals Court concluded that this

“made   it   possible   for   the   jury   to   accept,   without

challenge by the defendant, the prosecutor’s claim that

the defendant believed herself to be guilty of the
                               97
battery in stark contradiction of her defense”. Id.

Accordingly, the Appeals Court reversed.

      Cara   was   prejudiced    by        the   instruction.      The

Commonwealth’s case was not strong, as evidenced by the

two prior mistrials. This “serve[s] as a meaningful

benchmark    for   determining       the    likelihood    that     the

outcome of the third trial was affected by the . . .

mistake.” Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d at 35-36. The

instruction put a thumb on the scale in favor of the

prosecution’s argument, despite its weak evidentiary

basis.77 Because “one cannot say, with fair assurance,

after pondering all that happened without stripping the

erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was

not substantially swayed by the error,” Kelly, 470 Mass.

at 688, reversal is required.

VI.   The prosecutor’s closing argument, which misstated
      facts and attacked defense counsel, created a
      substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.
      The    prosecutor’s   closing         argument     created     a

substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice under

G.L. c. 278, § 33E.78

      77
       Cf. Commonwealth v. Stuckich, 450 Mass. 449, 454
(2008) (“the instruction, with its implication that
there was indeed evidence that the defendant had
demonstrated consciousness of guilt, could well have
affected the verdict[,]” which, in combination with
other errors created a substantial risk of a miscarriage
of justice).
    78  For convenience the appellant includes the
prosecutor’s closing argument in her record appendix.
R.A.130.
                                98
     A.    The prosecutor made multiple material factual
           misstatements.
     Prosecutors    have     a     duty   to   “argue   the

Commonwealth’s case . . . in a way that states the

evidence clearly and fairly.” Commonwealth v. Cyr, 433

Mass. 617, 626 (2001). They “must also take caution not

to misstate the evidence.” Commonwealth v. Coren, 437

Mass. 723, 730 (2002). Where a prosecutor misrepresents

the facts to such an extent that he renders the trial

fundamentally unfair, he violates the defendant’s state

and federal constitutional rights to due process of law.

           1.   The record on rigor mortis.

     The   prosecutor      grossly   mischaracterized   the

evidence on rigor mortis in closing argument: “Virtually

all of the medical examiners in this case testified that

well-developed rigor mortis which Ann was displaying at

7:15 that evening takes at least four to six hours, if

not more.” Tr.3:12:144. This claim ignored that: (1) the

first plausibly useful assessment of Ann’s rigor mortis

was not made until sometime after 9:20 p.m., (2) Dr.

Arden indicated that well-developed rigor can occur as

soon as three hours after death, and (3) given the

undisputed evidence of a violent struggle immediately

before Ann’s death, the onset of rigor likely occurred

in less than four to six hours, not “more”.

           2.   The record on Cara’s concealment of the
                crime


                              99
     Next, the prosecutor misrepresented the evidence

that Cara “concealed” the crime. First, he pointed to

Guilianelli’s      opinion        that     the      paint        had   been

intentionally poured on Ann’s body shortly before first

responders     arrived.      In     an    effort     to     bolster     the

credibility of the experiments on which Guilianelli’s

purported to base this opinion, the prosecutor asserted,

falsely, that “all variables were taken into account.”

Id. at 153. See Argument III, supra.

     Second, he claimed that Cara threw out a rag that

tested “presumptively positive for blood . . . with Ann’s

DNA”.   Tr.3:12:150.        Then,    addressing          the   undisputed

expert testimony that it was degraded and Dr. Bieber’s

unchallenged      opinion    that    it    had     not    been    “freshly

deposited”, he argued, “And degraded, not degraded, why

degraded, there are so many variables here with how

little Dr. Bieber knows about the actual circumstances

of that rag, how he can say it’s not recent is beyond

me.” Id. This was grossly misleading.

     In short, this evidence did not prove that “Ann’s

DNA” was found on the rag in the trash can and it was

improper for the prosecutor to claim as much. More

importantly, Dr. Bieber explained that this “degraded”

DNA had not been freshly deposited and therefore ruled

out the possibility that it had been transferred after

Ann’s death in an effort to “conceal” the crime.

             3.    Analysis
                                  100
       Applying the factors laid out in Commonwealth v.

Silva-Santiago, 453 Mass. 782, 807-808 (2009)79, and the

gloss of G.L. c. 278, § 33E, Cara submits that the

prosecutor’s improper comment, in combination with other

errors, likely affected the jury’s verdict.

       First,       defense     counsel     did   not    object   to    the

misstatements of fact. Although courts typically view

this as a sign that the comments did not seem especially

prejudicial, see Commonwealth v. Johnston, 467 Mass.

674,        695   (2014),    the   defense   clearly      disputed     both

misstatements.              Defense    experts          challenged      the

significance of rigor mortis and the DNA on the rag.

       Second, the improper argument did not involve a

collateral matter. Rather, it went to the central issue

– identification of the perpetrator. The time of death

analysis was designed to disprove Cara’s alibi. And by

asserting that “Ann’s DNA” was on the rag, the prosecutor

attempted to support a claim that Cara cleaned up the

crime scene with evidence linked to the crime, building

on a claim that only Cara would have taken the time to

clean up the crime scene. Tr.3:12:146-47. Thus, this

claim distorted the only piece of physical evidence that

could have supported the theory that Cara cleaned up the

scene. In short, “the error[] very much went to the heart



       79
       Abrogated on other grounds by Commonwealth v.
Moore, 480 Mass. 799 (2018).
                                      101
of the case.” Silva-Santiago, 453 Mass. at 808. The SJC

has viewed this fact as crucial.80

     Third, the judge did not give specific curative

instructions. To the contrary, she gave a consciousness

of guilt instruction, sua sponte, for the first time

(Tr.3:12:193),    which    implicitly    validated    the

Commonwealth’s unsupported claim that Cara used the rag

to conceal the crime, and then disposed of it.81

     B.   The Prosecutor   Improperly   Attacked   Defense
          Counsel
     At the end of his closing argument, the prosecutor

expressed his personal opinion about strength of the

defense and questioned counsel’s motivation. He asserted

repeatedly that counsel was disingenuously trying to

plant “imaginary doubt”. This was improper.

     Specifically, he asserted that “Attorney Hoose . .
. has attempted to stir up in your minds . . . imaginary

doubt.” Tr.3:12:156. He then repeated the point: “the

defense wants you to” find “imaginary doubt”. Id. He

asserted, “in trying to . . . inject some doubt into

your minds, the defense has brought up Mark Oleksak,

Carla Daniele.” Id. Then one last time: “[W]hen all else

     80  Compare Coren, 437 Mass. at 731 (reversing first
degree murder conviction based on improper closing
argument; “[m]ost importantly, some of the misstatements
went to the heart of the case”) (emphasis added).
     81 Compare Commonwealth v. Beaudry, 445 Mass. 577,

585 (2005)(judge’s standard instructions did not address
the improprieties in Commonwealth’s closing); Coren, 437
Mass. at 731.
                           102
fails, let’s throw some cat hairs against the wall and

see if that sticks. Let’s see if that trips up any of

you to find some imaginary doubt.” Id. at 157.82

     A prosecutor’s “injection of personal belief” about

the strength of the evidence and motivation of defense

counsel is improper. See Commonwealth v. Jenkins, 458

Mass. 791, 798 (2011). Likewise, “[d]isparaging remarks

about the . . . motivations of defense counsel. . . are

disfavored.” Commonwealth v. Awad, 47 Mass. App. Ct.

139, 142 (1999).

     While the prosecutor’s expression of opinion about

the strength of the evidence and motivation of defense

counsel might not warrant reversal on its own, in the

third retrial of a fiercely disputed            circumstantial

capital    case   it   unfairly   prejudiced   the   defense   by

reducing    the    Commonwealth’s     burden   of    proof.    In

combination with all the other trial errors discussed

above, it warrants reversal.

VII. Cara was deprived of her constitutional right to
     due process when she was subjected to a third trial.
     The Commonwealth’s approach to the third trial in

this case violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the

Fifth Amendment, and denied Cara due process.

     The Supreme Court has explained the policy behind

the Double Jeopardy Clause:


     82Crime scene technicians found many cat hairs on
Ann’s body even though the Rintalas did not own a cat.
                              103
        The underlying idea, one that is deeply
        ingrained in at least the Anglo-American
        system of jurisprudence, is that the State
        with all its resources and power should not be
        allowed to make repeated attempts to convict
        an individual for an alleged offense, thereby
        subjecting [her] to embarrassment, expense and
        ordeal and compelling [her] to live in a
        continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as
        well as enhancing the possibility that even
        though innocent [she] may be found guilty.
Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187-188 (1957)

(emphasis added).

     After two hung juries, the Commonwealth changed its

trial presentation. First, it hired David Guilianelli to

develop an inculpatory opinion that the paint had been

intentionally poured to contaminate the crime scene. As

explained    in     Argument   III,   supra,   this   opinion   was

unreliable and should have been excluded. But the fact

that the Commonwealth did not even seek out this opinion

until two mistrials revealed the weaknesses of its case

raises a separate due process concern.

     Second, after watching the performance of lead

investigator Magarian on cross-examination in the first

two trials, and the performance of the primary third-

party     suspect    Mark   Oleksak    in   the   second   trial,

prosecutors decided not to call these two, central fact

witnesses at the third trial. This decision to present

less evidence at the third trial was a clear effort to

minimize the weaknesses in the Commonwealth’s case.



                                104
     The   Commonwealth    took     unfair   advantage    of   two

mistrials to improve its case without advancing any

reliable new evidence. Prosecutors cannot be permitted

to revise their case after every mistrial until they

find a successful mix of evidence to obtain a conviction.

This was a violation of Cara’s constitutional right to

due process, requiring reversal.

                          CONCLUSION
     This Court should vacate Cara Rintala’s conviction

and remand to the superior court for a new trial. In the

alternative,   this   Court   should    vacate   the     superior

court’s denial of her new trial motion and remand the

case to the superior court for an evidentiary hearing,

reassigning the case to a new judge.

By the Court (Rubin, Maldonado & Lemire, JJ. 1 )



                  MEMORANDUM AND ORDER PURSUANT TO RULE 1:28

 *1 A jury convicted the defendant, Beth L. Diantonio, of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, § 13A
(a). In this consolidated appeal, the defendant challenges (1) the sufficiency of the Commonwealth
evidence to support a conviction, (2) the judge's denial of her motion for a new trial, which
was premised on the judge's failure to inform counsel before closing arguments that he would
be instructing on consciousness of guilt, and (3) trial counsel's performance. We conclude that,
although the evidence was sufficient, the order denying the motion for a new trial must be reversed
because the judge's failure to notify trial counsel of his intention to instruct on consciousness of
guilt prior to summations resulted in prejudicial error. See Commonwealth v. Degro, 432 Mass.
319, 332 (2000).

Discussion. 1. Sufficiency. The defendant contends that the Commonwealth's case deteriorated
when (1) the prosecution witnesses offered differing accounts of how many times the defendant
struck the victim, (2) the photographic evidence did not amply depict the location of the victim's

             © 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim toAdd.132
                                                 original U.S. Government Works.                  1
Commonwealth v. Diantonio, 94 Mass.App.Ct. 1122 (2019)
123 N.E.3d 802

injuries, (3) an officer on the scene testified that he observed no injuries on the victim when he
interviewed her after the altercation, and (4) the defendant and her boyfriend testified that it was
the victim who punched the defendant, and not the converse. We are not persuaded.

At trial, the Commonwealth proceeded on the theory that the defendant committed a harmful
battery. As such, the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant (1) touched the
victim, (2) intentionally, (3) without any right or excuse, and (4) “with such violence that bodily
harm is likely to result.” Commonwealth v. Geordi G., 94 Mass. App. Ct. 82, 85 (2018), quoting
Commonwealth v. Eberhart, 461 Mass. 809, 818 (2012). The Commonwealth supported this theory
with the testimony of the victim and two other witnesses, who together testified that the defendant
grabbed the victim, threw her to the ground, and punched her repeatedly. This evidence, viewed
in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see Commonwealth v. Latimore, 378 Mass.
671, 677 (1979), is sufficient. See Commonwealth v. Gray, 85 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 86-88 (2014)
(evidence that defendant punched victim's head repeatedly sufficient to prove harmful battery).

Deterioration occurs when the Commonwealth's evidence “is later shown to be incredible or
conclusively incorrect.” Commonwealth v. O'Laughlin, 446 Mass. 188, 203 (2006), quoting Kater
v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 17, 20 (1995). The defendant asserts that the evidence she presented
drastically differed from the Commonwealth's evidence, and did just that. We disagree. The
defendant's evidence “simply tended to contradict the Commonwealth's evidence; it did not show
it to be ‘incredible or conclusively incorrect.’ ” O'Laughlin, supra at 204, quoting Kater, supra.
Even the absence of photographic or police corroboration of the victim's injuries, while potentially
diminishing of the strength of Commonwealth's case, did not render the Commonwealth's evidence
conclusively incorrect. Accordingly, no deterioration occurred.

 *2 2. Consciousness of guilt instruction. The defendant also asserts that the judge abused his
discretion in denying her motion for a new trial because the consciousness of guilt instruction
lacked an evidentiary basis and, further, because he gave it without providing the defendant notice
of his intention to so instruct prior to closing arguments. 2

We review the denial of the motion for a new trial to determine whether it was “an abuse of
discretion that produces a manifestly unjust result.” Commonwealth v. Pingaro, 44 Mass. App. Ct.
41, 48 (1997). A judge commits an abuse of discretion by making “ ‘a clear error of judgment
in weighing’ the factors relevant to the decision ... such that the decision falls outside the range
of reasonable alternatives.” L.L. v. Commonwealth, 470 Mass. 169, 185 n.27 (2014), quoting
Picciotto v. Continental Cas. Co., 512 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 2008).

A judge is within his discretion to instruct on consciousness of guilt when “there is an ‘inference of
guilt that may be drawn from evidence of flight, concealment, or similar acts.’ ” Commonwealth
v. Morris, 465 Mass. 733, 738 (2013), quoting Commonwealth v. Stuckich, 450 Mass. 449, 453

(2008). “In the case of flight, the evidence must be probative of the defendant's feelings of guilt
concerning the crime of which [s]he is accused.” Commonwealth v. Villafuerte, 72 Mass. App.
Ct. 908, 908 (2008). Here, both the victim and others testified that after the victim screamed for
someone to call the police, the defendant left the scene of the incident with her boyfriend. The
jury could have viewed her departure from the scene before the arrival of police as evidence of her
guilty consciousness. See Commonwealth v. Prater, 431 Mass. 86, 97 (2000). Even if there were
other “possible explanations for a defendant's flight, it is for the jury to decide if the defendant's
actions resulted from consciousness of guilt or some other reason.” Id. Accordingly, the judge
acted within his discretion in deciding that an instruction on consciousness of guilt was warranted.
See id.

That said, “[a] trial judge must inform counsel of his proposed instructions before final argument.”
Degro, 432 Mass. at 332. A judge's failure to do so, rises to prejudicial error when, as was the case
here, “the defense [is] undermined ... because ‘the critical role of good argument was vitiated.’ ”
Commonwealth v. Thomas, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 183, 187 (1985), quoting United States v. Viserto,
596 F.2d 531, 539 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 841 (1979).

Here, the defendant's summation did not focus on the defendant's flight from the scene. In contrast,
the prosecutor labeled the defendant's flight “probably the most important evidence” in the trial.
The contrast was particularly critical here because the trial came down to a credibility contest
between the witnesses on each side. The unannounced instruction made it possible for the jury
to accept, without challenge by the defendant, the prosecutor's claim that the defendant believed
herself to be guilty of the battery in stark contradiction of her defense. Cf. Commonwealth v.
Woodbine, 461 Mass. 720, 732-738 (2012) (defendant prejudiced by inability to test officer's
credibility with suppressed statement he had used to refresh recollection before trial). In our view,
the error significantly undermined the defense, and a new trial is warranted. 3

CALABRIA, Judge.

Monty Wood Poteat (“defendant”) appeals from a judgment entered upon a jury verdict finding
him guilty of first-degree murder. We find no error.



                                                I. Background

Defendant was in a relationship with Vicki Foxx (“Foxx”) from 2001 until 2006. The couple lived
together in Foxx's home during this time. In 2002, Foxx filed for a Domestic Violence Protective
Order (“DVPO”) against defendant. However, Foxx later voluntarily dismissed this DVPO. In
2006, after Foxx filed for another DVPO against defendant (“the 2006 DVPO”), defendant moved
out of Foxx's home. In November 2006, Foxx's friend Lawanna Morton (“Morton”) moved into
Foxx's home because her own home had been damaged in a fire.

State v. Poteat, 210 N.C.App. 759 (2011)
711 S.E.2d 531



Defendant violated the 2006 DVPO on three separate occasions. On 4 October 2006, Deputy
Kasey Cornwell (“Deputy Cornwell”) of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department (“the Sheriff's
Department”) arrested defendant for one of the violations. During this arrest, Deputy Cornwell
noticed two firearms, a rifle and a .32 caliber pistol (“the pistol”), in defendant's apartment.
Defendant claimed they belonged to the owner of the apartment building, Bobby Motz (“Motz”).
At that time, Motz confirmed to Deputy Cornwell that he owned the firearms. However, Motz later
admitted that the firearms belonged to defendant. Deputy Cornwell recorded the serial numbers
of the rifle and the pistol.

In January 2007, defendant lived in a home with two other men, which was located approximately
a ten-minute walk from Foxx's home. Defendant's final violation of the 2006 DVPO occurred on 1
January 2007, when defendant walked across Foxx's property. When Morton and Foxx discovered
that defendant was on their property, Morton, who was a part-time deputy with the Sheriff's
Department, confronted defendant while Foxx called 911.

Two weeks later, on 15 January 2007, Foxx awoke at 5:30 a.m. As Foxx got ready for her job
at the Robert Bosch Tool Company (“Bosch Tool”), she heard Morton coughing behind Morton's
closed bedroom door. Foxx left for work at 7:15 a.m.

That same day, defendant's roommate woke up at 6:15 a.m. and noticed that defendant was not
home. Defendant returned home at 6:30 a.m., took a spotlight outside, then re-entered the home
five to ten minutes later. Defendant left the home again at approximately 7:00 a.m. and did not
return until between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. When defendant returned home, his roommate noted
that defendant was out of breath and immediately “washed up for about thirty minutes, and washed
the clothes that he had on and throwed them in the dryer.”

 *2 While Foxx was at work, she received a call from Morton's friend Ann Sadler (“Sadler”).
Sadler had been unsuccessfully attempting to contact Morton throughout the day and became
concerned that something was wrong. Foxx asked Sadler to drive by her home to see if Morton
was there. When Sadler did so, she found Morton's vehicle parked outside. Sadler knocked on the
front door of the home, but no one answered.

Sadler then drove home and called Foxx at work. Foxx told Sadler that she would leave work
as soon as she could. Foxx left work at 3:00 p.m. and got home approximately 25 minutes later.
When she arrived, she unlocked the door and called out Morton's name as she walked to her room.
Foxx entered Morton's room and began to pull back the sheets on Morton's bed when she found
Morton's body covered in blood. Foxx immediately called 911 and ran to a neighbor's house in
search of help. When emergency personnel arrived, they determined Morton was dead. The cause
of Morton's death was multiple gunshot wounds to the head.

State v. Poteat, 210 N.C.App. 759 (2011)
711 S.E.2d 531



Lincoln County Medical Examiner Jeffrey Lee Paysour (“M.E.Paysour”) was called to Foxx's
home to examine Morton's body. When M.E. Paysour performed an initial physical examination
of Morton's body at 8:45 p.m., he discovered that Morton's body was in full rigor mortis. Based
upon this observation, M.E. Paysour determined that Morton had been dead for at least eight to
ten hours. He estimated Morton's time of death as 7:30 a.m.

Deputy Justin Lee Frye (“Deputy Frye”) of the Sheriff's Department was one of the officers
who investigated Morton's death. Deputy Frye was familiar with the history of domestic violence
between defendant and Foxx because Foxx's home was located in his patrol area. As a result,
he considered defendant a suspect in Morton's murder. Deputy Frye went to defendant's home
to arrest him on an outstanding warrant for defendant's most recent DVPO violation. However,
defendant was not at home. Later that evening, defendant turned himself in to law enforcement
for violation of the DVPO.

A few days later, law enforcement officers searched defendant's property. A pistol was recovered
thirty yards behind defendant's home, where it was buried under leaves, wrapped in a towel, and
inside a plastic bag. The pistol was confirmed to be the same one that Deputy Cornwell previously
identified during defendant's October 2006 arrest.

Defendant was arrested and indicted for first-degree murder. While incarcerated and awaiting
trial, defendant spoke with a cell mate, Tarrie Allen Aiken, Jr. (“Aiken”), about Morton's murder.
Defendant told Aiken, in detail, how he had entered Foxx's house and shot and killed Morton with
a .32 caliber pistol. Defendant additionally stated to Aiken that he shot Morton in the head multiple
times in order to ensure she was dead, and that he covered her with a sheet after the shooting.

Defendant was tried by a jury beginning 9 November 2009 in Lincoln County Superior Court. At
trial, the State entered into evidence, over defendant's objection, Foxx's attendance record from
Bosch Tool for 15 January 2007. Deputy Frye testified that when he heard there was a murder at
Foxx's home, he initially thought defendant was a good suspect. Robert Woodward (“Woodward”),
another of defendant's cell mates, also testified about defendant's bizarre behavior while in jail.
On cross-examination, Woodward told defendant's counsel “even if I did attempt to kill a police
officer, at least they're not a helpless woman, like your client did .” M.E. Paysour additionally
testified, without objection, that, based upon the state of rigor mortis of Morton's body, he estimated
her time of death as 7:30 a.m.

*3 On 17 November 2009, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of first-degree
murder. The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without parole in the North
Carolina Department of Correction. Defendant appeals.

                                   II. Business Records Hearsay Exception

Defendant argues that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence a printout of Foxx's 15
January 2007 attendance record from Bosch Tool. We disagree.

“ ‘Hearsay’ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or
hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” N.C. Gen.Stat. § 8C–1, Rule
801(c) (2009). While hearsay is typically inadmissible as evidence under N.C. Gen.Stat. § 8C–
1, Rule 802 (2009), the Rules of Evidence provide a number of exceptions to this general rule,
including an exception for “Records of Regularly Conducted Activity” pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat.
§ 8C–1, Rule 803(6). This rule provides for the admission in evidence of:


            [a] memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts,
            events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from
            information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a
            regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that
            business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation,
            all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, unless
            the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate
            lack of trustworthiness. The term “business” as used in this paragraph includes
            business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of every
            kind, whether or not conducted for profit.


N.C. Gen.Stat. § 8C–1, Rule 803(6) (2009). Our Supreme Court has established the following test
for determining the admissibility of a computerized record pursuant to this rule:


            The rules of evidence governing the admissibility of computerized business
            records should be consistent with the reality of current business methods and
            should be adjusted to accommodate the techniques of a modern business world,
            with adequate safeguards to insure reliability. We therefore hold that printout
            cards or sheets of business records stored on electronic computing equipment
            are admissible in evidence, if otherwise relevant and material, if: (1) the
            computerized entries were made in the regular course of business, (2) at or
            near the time of the transaction involved, and (3) a proper foundation for such
            evidence is laid by testimony of a witness who is familiar with the computerized
            records and the methods under which they were made so as to satisfy the court

            that the methods, the sources of information, and the time of preparation render
            such evidence trustworthy.


State v. Springer, 283 N.C. 627, 636, 197 S.E.2d 530, 536 (1973).

In the instant case, the State attempted to admit Foxx's attendance record during the testimony
of Ronald Travis (“Travis”), Foxx's supervisor at Bosch Tool. Travis had been working at Bosch
Tool for thirty-two years. Travis testified that all employees at Bosch Tool have a security badge
containing a computer chip inside it. Employees are required to scan the badge in front of a time
clock at the beginning and end of each shift. This information is then recorded by the time clock.
Travis identified Foxx's attendance record for 15 January 2007, which was dated 16 January 2007
and indicated that she had worked seven hours and for the last hour of her shift had taken one hour
of vacation. The State then attempted to enter Foxx's attendance record into evidence. Defendant's
counsel objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. The State then continued to question
Travis in order to lay an adequate evidentiary foundation for the time sheet:

   *4 Q. [the State]: All right. Let me ask you a few more questions about this.

   A. [Travis]:Yes, sir.

   Q. This record, the time clock record, how can you tell that's Vicki Foxx's?

   A. It has Vicki Foxx's name on it. The badge that she has and the chip in the badge identifies
   her as that person.

   Q. All right. Have you looked at records like this before?

   A. Yes, sir.

   Q. Is this typical of the records in your thing [sic]?

   A. Yes, sir.

   Q. Does it appear to be the records that are kept on every employee that you have, right there?

   A. This looks exactly like a valid attendance record for Robert Bosch Tool.

   Q. All right, sir.

   [The State]: Again, I'll move to introduce these into evidence, Your Honor.

   [Defendant]: Objection.

State v. Poteat, 210 N.C.App. 759 (2011)
711 S.E.2d 531


   THE COURT: All right. [The attendance record] is admitted.

Travis's testimony and the attendance record itself demonstrate that Foxx's attendance record
met the three requirements set forth in Springer. Travis testified that all employees scanned their
security badge at the beginning and end of every shift, and this information was recorded by the
time clock. Thus, the attendance records were generated in the regular course of business. The
attendance record itself indicated that it had been generated on 16 February 2007, the day after
Foxx worked, and it was therefore unnecessary for Travis to testify that the attendance record was
made near the time Foxx scanned her badge. See State v. Wilson, 313 N.C. 516, 533, 330 S.E.2d
450, 462 (1985) ( “[I]f the records themselves show that they were made at or near the time of
the transaction in question, the authenticating witness need not testify from personal knowledge
that they were made at that time.”). Travis, who had worked with Bosch Tool for thirty-two years,
was familiar with the attendance records and how they were generated; he explained that Foxx's
security badge contained a unique identification chip which the time clock used to record the
hours she worked and identified Foxx's time sheet as a typical attendance record at Bosch Tool.
Therefore, the document was admissible under N .C. Gen.Stat. § 8C–1, Rule 803(6), and the trial
court properly overruled defendant's objection. This argument is overruled.



                                       III. Opinions of Defendant's Guilt

Defendant argues that the trial court erred by allowing two witnesses to offer their opinions that
defendant was guilty. Specifically, defendant contends that the trial court erred by permitting: (1)
Deputy Frye's testimony that he initially thought defendant might be a good murder suspect; and
(2) Woodward's testimony on cross-examination that “even if I did attempt to kill a police officer,
at least they're not a helpless woman, like your client did.” We disagree.

Initially, we note that defendant failed to object to either statement at trial. Thus, defendant's
argument is reviewed only for plain error. State v. Taylor, 362 N.C. 514, 543, 669 S.E.2d 239,
263 (2008).

    *5 [T]he plain error rule ... is always to be applied cautiously and only in the exceptional
   case where, after reviewing the entire record, it can be said the claimed error is a “fundamental
   error, something so basic, so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been
   done, or where [the error] is grave error which amounts to a denial of a fundamental right of
   the accused,” or the error has “resulted in a miscarriage of justice or in the denial to appellant
   of a fair trial” or where the error is such as to “seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public
   reputation of judicial proceedings” or where it can be fairly said the ... mistake had a probable
   impact on the jury's finding that the defendant was guilty.


              © 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim toAdd.141
                                                  original U.S. Government Works.                     6
State v. Poteat, 210 N.C.App. 759 (2011)
711 S.E.2d 531


State v. Odom, 307 N.C. 655, 660, 300 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1983) (quoting United States v. McCaskill,
676 F.2d 995, 1002 (4th Cir .1982)).


            Therefore, the test for “plain error” places a much heavier burden upon the
            defendant than [the burden] imposed by N.C.G.S. § 15A–1443 upon defendants
            who have preserved their rights by timely objection. This is so in part at least
            because the defendant could have prevented any error by making a timely
            objection.


State v. Cummings, 352 N.C. 600, 636, 536 S.E.2d 36, 61 (2000).

As defendant correctly notes, this Court has held that it is error for witnesses to “offer their opinions
of whether defendant was guilty.” State v. Carrillo, 164 N.C.App. 204, 210, 595 S.E .2d 219, 223
(2004). However, the statement made by Officer Frye, that he “thought maybe that at that point
in time, if it was in fact a murder, that [defendant] might be a good suspect at that point in time,”
did not constitute such an impermissible opinion. Frye did not offer an opinion that defendant
murdered Morton but rather an opinion that, based on his prior history, defendant would “be a
good suspect,” who warranted further investigation. Thus, Frye's testimony was not improper.

In addition, Woodward's statement was made in response to cross-examination from defendant's
counsel. “Statements elicited by a defendant on cross-examination are, even if error, invited error,
by which a defendant cannot be prejudiced as a matter of law.” State v. Gobal, 186 N.C.App. 308,
319, 651 S.E.2d 279, 287 (2007). This argument is overruled.



                               IV. Expert Testimony Estimating Time of Death

Defendant argues that the trial court erred by admitting M.E. Paysour's testimony estimating
Morton's time of death as 7:30 a.m. We agree, but find that the error did not rise to the level of
plain error.

Initially, we note that defendant failed to object to Paysour's estimation of Morton's time of death.
Thus, we again review defendant's argument only for plain error. Taylor, 362 N.C. at 543, 669
S.E.2d at 263.

The admissibility of expert opinion testimony is governed by N.C. Gen.Stat. § 8C–1, Rule 702,
which states that “[i]f scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of

711 S.E.2d 531

fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by
knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion.”
N.C. Gen.Stat. § 8C–1, Rule 702(a) (2009). Our Supreme Court has formulated the following test
for evaluating the admissibility of expert testimony: “(1) Is the expert's proffered method of proof
sufficiently reliable as an area for expert testimony? (2) Is the witness testifying at trial qualified
as an expert in that area of testimony? (3) Is the expert's testimony relevant?” State v. Ward, 364
N.C. 133, 140, 694 S.E.2d 738, 742 (2010). In the instant case, defendant challenges only the first
requirement, that the method of proof is sufficiently reliable as an area for expert testimony.

    *6 Determining the reliability of a method of proof is “a preliminary, foundational inquiry
   into the basic methodological adequacy of an area of expert testimony.” In order to determine
   whether an expert's area of testimony is considered sufficiently reliable, “a court may look to
   testimony by an expert specifically relating to the reliability, may take judicial notice, or may
   use a combination of the two.” Initially, the trial court should look to precedent for guidance
   in determining whether the theoretical or technical methodology underlying an expert's opinion
   is reliable.

Id. at 140, 694 S.E.2d at 742–43 (internal citations omitted).

Defendant did not attempt to challenge the validity of M.E. Paysour's opinion before the trial court.
On appeal, defendant cites as the basis of his argument various studies and treatises which appear
to indicate that the use of rigor mortis, standing alone, is not a sufficiently reliable method of
determining time of death. However, none of the information cited by defendant was presented to
the trial court. This Court has previously rejected a similar argument because “[a] defendant cannot
establish an abuse of discretion by the trial judge based on scientific literature never provided to
that judge.” State v. Anderson, 175 N.C.App. 444, 449, 624 S.E.2d 393, 398 (2006). Consequently,
it is unnecessary for this Court to determine the validity of the use of rigor mortis to determine
time of death. Defendant's argument, which is based upon scientific literature not presented to the
trial court, cannot demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing M.E. Paysour's
testimony.

Nonetheless, defendant has identified a deficiency in M.E. Paysour's opinion. M.E. Paysour
testified repeatedly that he examined Morton's body at 8:45 p.m. and that, as a result of this
examination, he determined that Morton had been dead at least eight to ten hours. Thus, according
to M.E. Paysour, Morton had been dead since at least 10:45 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. However, while
M.E. Paysour's estimate allowed for Morton's body to have been in full rigor mortis for up to
an additional twenty-six hours, there is nothing in M.E. Paysour's testimony to indicate why he
placed Morton's time of death at 7:30 a.m., approximately fifteen hours prior to his examination.
While M.E. Paysour testified that rigor mortis can vary based upon temperature or muscle mass,
he did not identify either of those factors as a basis for his estimate. Instead, on cross-examination,
M.E. Paysour testified specifically that he did not consider the temperature inside or outside Foxx's

home when he examined Morton's body. Moreover, M.E. Paysour did not testify that he considered
any other factors in reaching his determination of Morton's time of death. Since it is unclear from
his testimony what other factors besides Morton's state of rigor mortis, if any, were used by M.E.
Paysour to bring his estimate of Morton's time of death outside the initial eight-to-ten-hour window
predicted by Morton's state of rigor mortis, his method of proof for determining Morton's time of
death cannot be said to be sufficiently reliable to be admissible at trial under Rule 702. Thus, the
trial court abused its discretion by admitting M.E. Paysour's estimate of Morton's time of death.

 *7 However, even though M.E. Paysour's testimony was erroneously admitted, “defendant has the
burden of showing that the error constituted plain error, that is, (i) that a different result probably
would have been reached but for the error or (ii) that the error was so fundamental as to result in
a miscarriage of justice or denial of a fair trial.” State v. Bishop, 346 N.C. 365, 385, 488 S.E.2d
769, 779 (1997). Defendant has not met his burden in the instant case.

The State presented evidence that, after he was arrested, defendant told his cell mate, Aiken,
in detail, that he surreptitiously obtained a key to Foxx's house, that he used that key to enter
Foxx's house and shoot Morton repeatedly in the head with a .32 caliber pistol, and that he
covered Morton's body with a sheet. Foxx discovered Morton's body covered by a sheet, and a .32
caliber pistol was found hidden in the land surrounding defendant's home. The pistol had been
previously identified as belonging to defendant, as it was the same pistol that had been recorded
by Deputy Cornwell when he had previously arrested defendant. Defendant had previously had a
confrontation with Morton two weeks prior to her murder. Finally, several witnesses testified that
defendant made threatening statements regarding Morton, including a statement that he would kill
Morton if he ever got the chance. Considering this evidence, we cannot conclude that but for M.E.
Paysour's testimony, a different result would have been reached at defendant's trial. This argument
is overruled.



                                           V. Cumulative Errors

Defendant argues cumulative errors deprived him of a fair trial. Since defendant has failed to
identify any errors that occurred during his trial under the applicable standard of appellate review,
we necessarily find no cumulative error. See State v. Roddey, 110 N.C.App. 810, 816, 431 S.E.2d
245, 249 (1993). This argument is overruled.



                                             VI. Conclusion

The trial court properly admitted Foxx's attendance record for 15 January 2007 under N.C.
Gen.Stat. § 8C–1, Rule 803(6). The trial court did not err by allowing Deputy Frye to testify

that he thought defendant was a good suspect for Morton's murder as this was not an opinion
that defendant was guilty. Moreover, the trial court did not err by allowing Woodward to express
an opinion regarding defendant's guilt because the opinion was elicited during defendant's cross-
examination of the witness. Finally, the trial court erred by allowing M.E. Paysour to testify about
his estimate of Morton's time of death. However, since defendant did not object to this estimate
and failed to show that a different result probably would have been reached but for the error, this
error did not constitute plain error.

No error.



Judges GEER and STEPHENS concur.
Report per Rule 30(e).
